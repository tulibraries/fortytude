<p>I have read and understand the terms and conditions of the Library Data Grants program. I understand that awardees will be notified by December 15 and get access to the data during the spring term. I also understand that if awarded, I will attend a brown bag lunch to discuss how I used the data in my research or pedagogical work. For published research in which the data is used, I will include this statement, "The author wishes to acknowledge the Temple University Librariesâ€™ funding for data used in this research."</p>
