<p>Lockers are available on a first-come/first-served basis for graduate students and faculty in the Charles Library. Due to high demand and the limited number of lockers (32), we cannot guarantee that a locker will be available to each patron who makes a request. We will email you to let you know if a locker is available once we receive your request.</p>
