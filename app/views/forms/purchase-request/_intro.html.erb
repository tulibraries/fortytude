<p>Members of the Temple University community may request the purchase of materials the Libraries do not currently own for inclusion in our collections. Requests will be considered in light of our collection development policy and the availability of the item in the desired format. A Temple University email address is required so that the Libraries can verify the requestor's affiliation.</p>
<p>Requests will be forwarded to the library at the patron's home campus.</p>
