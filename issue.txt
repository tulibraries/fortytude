  A Category needs a relation t them items that are in that caegory, which can be of any Entity type.
  
  This feels like a clear use case for polymorphic has_many through, so we will need a 
  * relation model called Categorization
    * has  "categorizable_id" and "categorizable_type" column
    * belongs_to :categorizable, :polymorphic => true
    * belongs_to :category
  
  And then Category model needs "has_many categories"
