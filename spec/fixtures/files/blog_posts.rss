<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every year, books in schools and libraries are challenged, meaning a person or group has requested their removal or restriction. The reasons for these challenges range from objections to explicit content, offensive language, age-inappropriate material, and more. Yet, most challenges are unsuccessful due to the hard work of librarians, teachers, students, and community members who support and promote our freedom to openly access information and literature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Check out our display on the first floor of Paley Library, across from the service desk. The featured books have all been challenged at some point in libraries and schools, along with many other frequently challenged books. Consider checking one out and support your freedom to seek and express ideas. </span></p>

Filmed over a ten year period, the documentary portrays Christopher “Quest” Rainey and his wife Christine’a “Ma Quest” as they raise a family in North Philadelphia while nurturing a community of hip hop artists in their home music studio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Join us at </span><b>5:00 PM at the Reel Cinema</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> (Student Center South, Lower Level, 1755 N. 13th Street) to watch the film and hear from the director and members of the Rainey family in a Q&amp;A afterwards. All programs are free and open to all. </span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had the opportunity to speak with Jonathan ahead of the screening and ask him about his time as a Temple student, his experience working on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Quest</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, and the films we all need to watch. </span></p>
<p><b>Beckie: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Can you tell us a little bit about your experiences as a Temple student? When did you know you wanted to study filmmaking?</span></p>
<p><b>Jonathan: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I grew up in Pittsburgh and started making little videos with borrowed consumer camcorders when I was in middle school, and then in high school I started making skate videos with my brothers and some friends that included a little bit of skateboarding and a lot of random craziness. We called ourselves Loathly Lady Skate Company. We started selling VHS tapes locally and on the internet. By the time I graduated from high school in 2000, I wanted to go deeper and continue to make movies. Temple had a film program with a great reputation and I was able to get in-state tuition so I moved to Philadelphia and have been here ever since.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As an undergraduate I double majored in Film and Media Arts and English Literature. I ended up making a bunch of experimental videos and was introduced to interactive New Media, which really captured my imagination. My senior thesis project was an interactive narrative that weaves a number of related storylines together called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Memoir: The Oral History</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Technology is changing with Flash going out of style, but it can still be accessed online—</span><a href="http://whispersinthestorm.com/memoir/"><span style="font-weight: 400">http://whispersinthestorm.com/memoir/</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also developed a love for still photography and, after graduation in 2004, documentary photography.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_2250" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/QUEST-JonathanOlshefski.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2250" src="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/QUEST-JonathanOlshefski-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jonathan Olshefski, director; credit: Carina Romano</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started a photo essay with the Rainey family in 2006 and soon began to think that maybe there was a film there. In 2007, I returned Temple to make the leap from still photography to documentary film and started Film and Media Arts MFA program. This was the dawn of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">QUEST </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">the film. I didn&#8217;t know at the time, but the journey would last longer than I or anyone else ever would have imagined.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Beckie: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to talk more about your experience filming </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Quest</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, but first I have to ask you about when you used to work here in the library! Can you tell us about that? Are there any ways it’s served you in your career?</span></p>
<p><b>Jonathan:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">I was a clerk at the circulation desk and I would work the evening shift that ended at midnight. I’m a night owl, so it worked for me and as things weren’t too busy, it was a good opportunity to do homework or read. I mostly remember conversations with co-workers. I do remember that I looked pretty wild back then. I pretty much wore rags that were safety pinned together all the time. I would get some weird looks, but I was super polite and helpful and that would win people over. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Beckie:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> That sounds like a pretty great student job! Back to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Quest</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">—you</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> followed and filmed the Rainey family for a decade. How did you know the Raineys would be good subjects for a movie? What was it like being present for so many personal moments?</span></p>
<p><b>Jonathan:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> The Raineys are just incredible people. They are community builders who go all out for their family and their neighborhood. The Raineys and I wanted to showcase the beauty and strength of the neighborhood from the point of view of the people who actually live there. North Philly is often misunderstood, and this film provided us an opportunity to put the true story out there and really celebrate the strength of a community that is under siege from a number of angles.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_2252" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/QUEST-FilmStill3-stoop.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2252 size-large" src="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/QUEST-FilmStill3-stoop-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="390" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Christopher “Quest” Rainey, Isaiah Byrd, Christine’a “Ma Quest” Rainey, Patricia “PJ” Rainey; credit: Carina Romano</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Raineys became like family over the years. They embraced me as an artist and a collaborator, but also as a friend. There were a lot of ups and downs throughout the course of making this film and there were many times where I was laughing behind the camera and other times where I was crying behind the camera. The friendship and the trust that comes with it is what made this film possible and I am really honored to have shared so many personal moments with the Rainey family and their community. I’m just happy that we all feel good about the final film and we are all working hard to ensure that the film has a real impact in our world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a lot of ways we are just at the beginning because we want to use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">QUEST</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to support the Rainey family’s mission to build community and bring healing to North Philly and places like it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Beckie: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like part of what allowed you to finish the film was winning a MacArthur Foundation grant in 2016—congrats by the way! Where were you when you found out you won? What did that grant enable you to do?</span></p>
<p><b>Jonathan:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I got word of this in December 2015. I don&#8217;t remember where I was exactly, but I know that it was a crazy week. To the point of being almost surreal. Not only did we get the MacArthur Grant, but we also received word that public TV wanted to support that project through a co-production with ITVS and I also learned that I was approved for tenure at Rowan University. I never had three long-term, high-risk investments pay off over the course of a few days like that before or since.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The MacArthur grant provided an incredible boost as it paved the way for us to jump full steam into our post-production process and really embark on editing the film. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Beckie: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">That definitely does sound like a crazy, incredible week!</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">And thanks for mentioning the fact that you also teach filmmaking. For those of us studying or interested in documentary filmmaking, can you suggest any essential films or directors we have to check out?</span></p>
<p><b>Jonathan: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh man! There&#8217;s so many.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really connect to a film called </span><a href="https://temple-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01TULI_ALMA21259979410003811&amp;context=L&amp;vid=TULI&amp;search_scope=default_scope&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US"><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Dark Days</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. It was made by a first-time filmmaker. It is a really interesting example of what can happen when a filmmaker collaborates with his subjects to tell a story and takes his time to really convey the spectrum of human experience and not just parachute in for the sensationalized surface story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So many amazing documentaries were released in 2017 alongside </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">QUEST</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. I am just very proud to be part of such an incredible group of storytellers. See these films as most of them are now available!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Tuesday, March 13, the Libraries hosted a panel on representation and identity in the art world and participated in our third annual <a href="http://www.artandfeminism.org/">Art+Feminism Wikipedia Edit-a-thon</a>. This international program brings together participants in one space to update Wikipedia entries on subjects related to gender, art, and feminism over the course of an afternoon.</p>
<p>In a 2011 survey, the Wikimedia Foundation found that less than 10% of its contributors were women. While the reasons for the gender gap are up for debate, the practical effect of this disparity is not: content is skewed by the lack of representation from women.</p>
<p>In order to establish the context for issues associated with art, gender, and representation, we began the morning with a panel moderated by Dr. Jennifer Zarro, art historian, writer, curator, and faculty at the Tyler School of Art, and composed of Mechella Yezernitskaya, co-curator of Beyond Boundaries: Feminine Forms, and Kate Kraczon, the Laporte associate curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art at Penn. The three discussed being art curators; the importance of mentorship; barriers related to gender, race, and class in the museum world; the canon of art history; myths of the art world; and so much more.</p>

<p>We then transitioned to our afternoon of Wikipedia editing. Librarian Caitlin Shanley provided a tutorial for beginner Wikipedians and the lecture hall was soon bustling with conversation and serious editing work.</p>
<div id="attachment_2246" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/MG_5097.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2246 size-medium" src="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/MG_5097-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo courtesy Brae Howard</p></div>
<p>Participation in the edit-a-thon at the Libraries has steadily increased over the three years since its debut, with a record turnout this year. According to Jill Luedke, program organizer and art, art history, and architecture librarian, coordinating with faculty ahead of time played a huge role in bringing in more students throughout the day.</p>
<div id="attachment_2245" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/MG_5122.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2245 size-medium" src="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/MG_5122-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/MG_5122-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/MG_5122-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/MG_5122-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2018/03/MG_5122-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo courtesy Brae Howard</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adrienne Shaw, assistant professor in the Department of Media Studies and Production, brought her LGBT Media Representation class to the edit-a-thon, and even incorporated the activity into her coursework. Her goal was to have students use the materials, resources, and knowledge from her course to identify gaps in existing Wikipedia entries about LGBTQ media texts and Philadelphia LGBTQ historical events and find additional sources to add to them. The group setting provided space for asking questions and collaboration as each student edited at least one entry.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who came out to this wonderful program. Let’s keep working toward a more inclusive and representative Wikipedia world!</p>

Join us at </span><a href="https://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage/event/midday-arts-series-reading-1"><b>12:30 PM in the Paley Library Lecture Hall</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (1210 Polett Walk, Ground Floor) to hear Kathryn read.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">All programs are free and open to all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had the opportunity to speak with Kathryn ahead of her reading, and ask her about her time as a Temple student, writing in multiple genres, and what she thinks you should be reading. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Beckie</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: Can you tell us a little bit about your experiences as a Temple student? When did you know you wanted to study writing? </span></p>
<p><b>Kathryn</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: I actually applied to Temple as a psychology major. Although I had always wanted to be a writer, I viewed that desire as separate from any academic or career interests I had. This may have been because as much as I loved reading and taking creative writing classes in school, I wasn’t crazy about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Beowulf</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, for example, and mistakenly generalized the idea of an English major in that way. Once I visited Temple, I talked to professors about Hyphen and the Philadelphia Writers Conference and everything else that was exciting about writing and I realized that this was what I needed to be doing. I loved the electricity of the campus (and still do!) so much so that I decided to go for my MFA in Fiction, also at Temple, after I graduated. And I had a teaching assistantship, which is when I realized how much I like teaching as well as writing. </span></p>
<p><b>B:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> It sounds like Temple was a great place for you to develop as a writer. In terms of your work, you write and publish across genres, like poetry and fiction. How do you know when an idea is a poem or a story? What is your process like?</span></p>
<p><b>K:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">That’s a really good question and one that is tough to answer. I think the best way I can describe it is that poems come to me as more abstract feelings or moments that I wouldn’t be able to convey with a plot. Stories come to me as a larger concept, something more based in character and circumstance. And I suppose flash fiction is somewhere in between! Sometimes the same inspiration stays with me and lends itself to different genres.</span></p>
<p><b>B:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Speaking of inspiration—set the scene for us! You are writing, and the setting is perfect. Where are you and why?</span></p>
<p><b>K:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> A perfect writing day means that I will have conquered that terrible combination of procrastination and anxiety and the words are coming easily and it feels natural rather than forced. I’ve gotten some good writing done on the third floor of Paley library in those orange and wooden chairs. I’ve also got a spot at home next to a window where I work well. (Also, I think eating candy while I write helps. I’m sure a dentist would disagree). </span></p>
<p><b>B:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> You mentioned earlier how much you like teaching. How do you, as a writer, approach the teaching of writing?</span></p>
<p><b>K:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I try to approach it with empathy, because I know the terror of showing something personal to others and not knowing if they will like it or not. I try to convey the idea that writing is a process we rarely perfect on the first try, and that there are many different, legitimate kinds of writers and writing. I also encourage my students to immerse themselves in other art forms, whether that takes the form of music, visual art, film, or anything else.</span></p>
<p><b>B:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> What do you consider required reading for students who want to study writing?</span></p>
<p><b>K:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> There are a few classic short stories that you’ll find in many creative writing classes (including some of mine) such as “Cathedral” by Raymond Carver and “Sonny’s Blues” by James Baldwin. But the lessons they contain about structure and dialogue and character can be found in a great many other pieces. More than any list of texts, I think what’s most important is to read widely. Read writers of different races, ethnicities, and genders. Read fiction, poetry, and the unclassifiable. Here are some of my favorite authors and texts across genres that I’ve assigned recently or hope to assign soon:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Danez Smith, especially </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t Call Us Dead</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kim Addonizio, especially </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What Is This Thing Called Love</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice Munro, “Passion”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jamaica Kincaid, “Girl”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan Chaon, “The Bees”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Helen Ellis, “The Wainscoting Wars”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sam Weiner, “Your Mass Shooting Thoughts and Prayers Are Accidentally Going to the Angry God of a Distant Planet”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>B: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m definitely going to check those recommendations out! Thanks for your time, Kathryn, and we are looking forward to your reading next week.</span></p>

<p>On <strong>Wednesday, November 1,</strong> Temple’s Writer-in-Residence <a href="http://www.lizmoore.net/">Liz Moore</a> will participate in the Libraries’ <a href="https://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage/event/midday-arts-series-reading-liz">Midday Arts Series</a>, as part of the <a href="https://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage">Beyond the Page</a> public programming series. Join us at <strong>1:00 PM in the Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong> (1210 Polett Walk, Ground Floor) to hear Liz read from her latest novel, <em>The Unseen World</em>. All programs are free and open to all.</p>
<p>I was lucky to catch up with Liz ahead of her reading, to ask about her new role at Temple, her teaching philosophy, and her writing process.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Beckie:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Welcome to Temple! Can you tell us about your role as this year’s <a href="http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/liz-moore-2/">College of Liberal Arts Writer-in-Residence</a>?</span></p>
<p><b>Liz:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">I’m delighted to be serving as Writer in Residence for Temple’s MFA program. In this capacity, I’ll teach a fiction workshop and a section of Manuscript Tutorial in the Fall 2017 and Fall 2018 semesters. </span></p>
<p><b>B:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> As a writer, how do you approach the teaching of writing? </span></p>
<p><b>L:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">I open all of my writing workshops with a writing prompt. We then move into a discussion of an assigned, previously published text—usually something that illustrates some point of craft that I think is interesting. We then spend the rest of the class workshopping student pieces. More generally, my philosophy is to reserve time for three different categories of discussion: the everyday work of being a writer, including how to develop discipline and a routine and the motivation to sufficiently revise; the fine points of craft, including developing diction, voice, character, and structure; and “big picture” things like what motivates us to write, and what role literature has in our world today.</span></p>
<p><b>B:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I really appreciate how you make space to discuss those different categories, especially the everyday work of the writer. In terms of your own work, in 2014, you won the Rome Prize in Literature—congratulations by the way! What was that experience like, living and writing abroad for a year?</span></p>
<p><b>L: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you! The Rome Prize remains the one of the best gifts (and surprises) I’ve ever received. For a year, I was given a really beautiful workspace, room and board, and access to the beautiful city of Rome. It was the first and only time in my life that I’ve ever had nothing to do but write, and I tried to take advantage of that by being as productive as possible—while, of course, leaving time to see the city and the country. I met some really creative people who remain good friends, and finished writing my third novel, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Unseen World</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><b>B:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Speaking of which, has the writing process changed for you at all? What did it look like for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Unseen World</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span></p>
<p><b>L:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">I think my writing process changes with every novel I write. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Unseen World</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> was probably the most challenging for me, because it functions in some ways like a puzzle, and I had to come up with the right structure to accommodate that, which was tricky. It’s also my longest book by about a hundred pages, and it required a lot of research about fields I knew nothing about prior to writing this book, so it was a labor of love. The only constant I can take with me from book to book is the knowledge that a great deal of difficulty is just part of the process, so frustration doesn’t cause me to give up on what I’m writing these days—I just try to ride it out.</span></p>
<p><b>B:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Can you tell us a bit more about the unconventional structure of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Unseen World </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and your decision to move back and forth in time and space?</span></p>
<p><b>L: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The structure arose out of necessity, since the release of information had to be timed exactly right to preserve the central mystery of the book, and also a great deal of trial and error. I always tell myself I’m going to one day write a very straightforward book using a simple plot and structure, and then inevitably they spin out of control into something much bigger than my initial ideas.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week (October 23–29) is <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a>, a yearly international celebration that aims to increase awareness about open access (OA). Most academic work is available only to those who are affiliated with a college or university. However, many people from outside of the university community could also benefit from access to cutting-edge scholarship.<a href="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2017/10/OAlogo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2173 aligncenter" src="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2017/10/OAlogo-300x108.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="108" srcset="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2017/10/OAlogo-300x108.jpg 300w, https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2017/10/OAlogo-768x277.jpg 768w, https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2017/10/OAlogo-1024x369.jpg 1024w, https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2017/10/OAlogo-500x180.jpg 500w, https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2017/10/OAlogo.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Acknowledging this, researchers have begun to look for different ways to make their work more widely available to the general public. OA scholarship is completely free to read and reuse. Researchers can make their work OA by publishing in an OA journal or by sharing a version of their article in an open digital repository. There are also a growing number of publishers who produce OA books and digital projects.</p>
<p><strong>Temple University Libraries</strong> is joining the conversation about the importance of openly available scholarship through a series of events this week, including an exhibit, faculty workshop, panel presentation, and pop-up tables around campus. We invite you to stop by for the following:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><span style="color: #33cccc">EXHIBIT</span></strong><br />
<a href="https://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage/event/opening-research-temple">Opening Up Research @ Temple</a><br />
Monday, October 23–Friday, October 27, All Day<br />
Paley Library, 1210 Polett Walk, First Floor</p>
<p>In honor of Open Access Week, visit the Libraries for a special exhibit that profiles a few of the many Temple University faculty members who are committed to reaching a wide audience with their research. These faculty come from different disciplines, schools, and colleges, yet they all believe that scholarly information deserves to be read and used beyond the walls of the academy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #33cccc">FACULTY WORKSHOP</span></strong><br />
<a href="https://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage/event/open-access-week-ginsburg-0">Removing Barriers, Increasing Access</a><br />
Thursday, October 26, Noon–1:00 pm<br />
Ginsburg Health Sciences Library, Room 246a</p>
<p>Want to provide more equitable and barrier free access to your research or teaching materials? Learn how to publish your work in a more accessible format and provide barrier free course content for your students. Gain knowledge of publishing in open access (OA) journals and locating or creating your own open educational resources (OER).</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #33cccc">PANEL PRESENTATION</span></strong><br />
<a href="https://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage/event/open-order-change-world-how-tu">Open In Order to Change the World: How TU Libraries Are Helping to Democratize Access to Information</a><br />
Thursday, October 26, 2:00–3:00 pm<br />
Paley Library Lecture Hall, 1210 Polett Walk, Ground Floor</p>
<p>Librarians are changing the world of scholarly communication for the better. In honor of Open Access Week, join us for a discussion of how Temple University Libraries is working to increase access to information. From helping the City of Philadelphia <a href="https://news.temple.edu/news/2016-06-30/temple-university-libraries-wins-2016-knight-news-challenge-award">preserve open civic data</a>, to <a href="https://templepress.wordpress.com/2017/04/05/temple-university-press-and-libraries-receive-neh-grant-to-make-out-of-print-labor-studies-titles-openly-available/">digitizing and making freely available out-of-print Temple University Press books</a>, learn about some of the different projects the Libraries are undertaking that support not just Temple students and faculty, but the global scholarly community.</p>
<hr />
<p>Have questions about OA but can’t attend any of these events? Check out our <a href="http://guides.temple.edu/openaccess">OA research guide</a> and look for our pop-up OA tables around campus. We’ll have lots of resources to share as well as some fun OA swag.</p>

<p>I was lucky to catch up with Ryan ahead of his reading, to ask him about his work and life at Temple and in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beckie:</strong> Can you share with us the story of your journey from Temple grad student to published poet?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> I started in Temple’s MA poetry program in 2005 when I was 26. I wanted a break from waged work and more time to write poetry, and that’s what I got: two years of immersion in reading and writing—and teaching. A teaching assistantship paid for me to be there (which led to my work as an adjunct). Rachel Blau DuPlessis and Jena Osman were great teachers, as were a few classmates who remain friends today. The experience did not lead immediately or directly to any “success,” but I learned the importance of being in conversation with other writers. I overcame my shyness a bit and started going to more poetry readings to continue my education, which I regard as endless. Being part of a community of writers helps to sustain you over time, especially in a larger culture that does not value poetry or history.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> In that time, you’ve also published two books and are working on your latest poetry manuscript, <em>General Motors</em>. This collection centers around labor and the influence of public and private transportation on city life. What made you interested in exploring these themes?</p>
<p><strong>R:</strong> The book grew from my interest in the GM conspiracy to dismantle public transit in the 20th century, my family’s long history of working for SEPTA/PTC, and my own experience as a union activist and organizer. We live in an automobile society that has shaped just about every aspect of our lives, including the way we see one another, communicate with one another and dispose of one another. I’m interested in how the privatization of public goods and services impacts our relationships and our abilities to survive. In my writing I like to point at the injustices we live inside of and ask questions that make people aware of themselves. And I try to imagine better worlds—that’s the hardest part.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> How would you describe being a working poet in the city of Philadelphia?</p>
<p><strong>R:</strong> Fumbling with language in your head as you walk and ride through the city while also trying to get outside of your head. Fumbling with language in your head as you work your job while also trying to quit your job. Fumbling with language in your head as you talk to people while also trying to love those people. Fumbling with language in your head as you read and read and finally scribble the breath onto paper. Finally reading the poem out loud somewhere and feeling completely alive.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: That’s such a fascinating insight into how ever-present language is in your daily life. I wonder about the Pew Fellowship you were awarded last year—congratulations by the way! What did that award enable you to do?</p>
<p><strong>R</strong>: Thank you. The Pew has given me some very precious time to think and read and write. I’ve been able to finish writing a book that I would otherwise probably still be working on. The grant has allowed me to travel a bit, too. I visited Chile last year for the first time and got to hang out with my friend Carlos Soto-Román who introduced me to other poets there. That never would have happened on adjunct pay!</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> Yes, finding the time and space to work is so important! What other advice do you have for other aspiring poets?</p>
<p><strong>R:</strong> My advice is to not think of yourself as an “aspiring” poet. I never did. After I fell in love with poetry, I just started writing and never stopped. I didn’t know where it was going to lead (still don’t). My advice is read widely and keep writing and don’t listen to people who say what you’re doing has no value—remember that capitalist culture is absurd. Stay in touch with the thing inside you that compels you to make something, and trust that thing. And don’t get an MFA unless the university pays for it.</p>

<p>Every year, books in schools and libraries are challenged, meaning a person or group has requested their removal or restriction. The reasons for these challenges are manifold, ranging from objections to explicit content, offensive language, or age-inappropriate material. Yet, most challenges are unsuccessful due to the hard work of librarians, teachers, students, and community members who support and promote our freedom to openly access information and literature.</p>
<p>Check out our display on the first floor of Paley Library, across from the service desk. The featured books have all been challenged at some point in libraries and schools, along with many other frequently challenged books. Consider checking one out and support your freedom to read.</p>

This season features programs that explore the role of communities in our lives. How are we shaped by the language we use, the institutions we take part in, the places we’ve lived, and the people around us? The Beyond the Page series also consists of a variety of other programs, exhibitions, concerts, and events developed around timely topics and in collaboration with our on-and-off campus partners.</p>
<p>On <strong>Wednesday, September 20</strong>, check out our first themed program of the fall semester: <a href="https://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage/event/creating-welcoming-campus#"><strong>Creating a Welcoming Campus Community in 2017</strong></a>. This program will ask us to consider: What does a welcoming campus look like? How can we build a campus community that is truly welcoming? Meet us at <strong>12:00 PM in the Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong> (1210 Polett Walk, Ground Floor) for a conversation with Temple faculty, staff, students, and community leaders about the extent to which Temple is a welcoming place for international students, immigrants, and students and staff of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>This program takes place during the <a href="https://www.welcomingamerica.org/">Welcoming America</a> organization’s <a href="https://www.welcomingamerica.org/programs/welcoming-week">Welcoming Week</a>. This annual series of events brings together immigrants, refugees, and native-born residents to raise awareness of the benefits of welcoming everyone.</p>
<p>All programs are free and open to all, and make sure to check out our <a href="https://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage">program schedule</a> for updates and new programs as we move into fall.</p>

<p><strong>What Library Resources Are TUL Staff Members Most Thankful For?</strong></p>
<p>“I’m most thankful for the library’s video collection, as I’ve frequently used it for my film work. I’m also thankful for librarians who often direct me to the resources I need when I’m feeling overwhelmed and can’t find them.” –Gary Kramer, Publicity Manager, Temple University Press</p>
<p>“I am thankful for Interlibrary loan. I have gotten great books for both leisure and professional reading in the last few months that my local public library doesn’t have.” –Jenny Pierce, Head of Research, Education, and Outreach, Ginsburg Health Sciences Library</p>
<p>“Our committed, creative, &amp; talented staff.” –Joe Lucia, Dean of Libraries</p>
<p>“Access to full text journals! We have so many.” –Lauri Fennell, Reference/Patron Services, Ginsburg Health Sciences Library</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled that we now have online access to the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> for the entire 20th century (we had a gap of about 60 years previously). This is a huge improvement in access for students and faculty who are researching Philadelphia history in a wide range of disciplines. One faculty member told me it was the best news he’d heard in months!” –Rebecca Lloyd, Reference Librarian</p>

In the United States, fair use refers to both copyright laws and the exceptions that allow us to use copyrighted materials without permission. Students, teachers, scholars, librarians, and many others interact with copyrighted materials on a daily basis, and the principle of fair use facilitates honoring intellectual property rights and accommodating the flexible needs of academic settings, emerging technologies, and free expression.</p>
<p>Temple University Libraries is joining the conversation with two programs this week. Please join us!</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, February 21, 2:00 PM</strong><br />
<a href="http://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage/event/acrl-webcast-using-fair-use"><strong> ACRL Webcast, “Using Fair Use to Preserve and Share Disappearing Government Information: A Guide for Rogue Librarians”</strong></a><br />
The Libraries will host a viewing of this ACRL webinar that will introduce fair use as an equitable doctrine designed to support librarianship and prepare participants to apply fair use in their own communities’ work.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, February 22, 5:00 pm</strong><br />
<strong> <a href="http://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage/event/can-i-use-workshop-copyright">Can I Use That? A Workshop on Copyright and Fair Use</a></strong><br />
Resident Librarian Anastasia Chiu will host drop-in workshop that will cover basic principles of copyright, fair use, and using sources ethically, in a competitive question-and-answer game show format. There are prizes for winners!<br />
Register here: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/can-i-use-that-a-workshop-on-copyright-fair-use-tickets-31946843870">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/can-i-use-that-a-workshop-on-copyright-fair-use-tickets-31946843870</a></p>
<p>Both programs will be held in the Digital Scholarship Center on the Ground Floor of Paley Library.</p>

The program, produced as well as performed by students, is the result of their semester-long research of the culture, music, and history of this time period. This performance marks the culmination of their hard work, creativity, and talent and will begin at <strong>12:00 PM</strong> in the Ground Floor Lecture Hall at Paley Library.</p>
<p><em>The Music of the Great Migration: A Student Performance</em> features musical performances by: Noah Hockner-trumpet, Silas Irvine-piano, Josh Lee-Bari sax, Chris Lewis-tenor sax, Chris Oatts-alto sax, Nathan Pence-bass, and Donavan Pope-drums.</p>
<p>This performance is the final event in Temple University Libraries’ programming series <em>The Music of the Great Migration</em>, marking the 100th anniversary of the historic and culturally important movement of 6 million African Americans to the urban Northeast, Midwest, and West. This series featured musical performances, exhibitions, and film screenings, and encouraged students, faculty, and community members to enjoy the music of the Great Migration and participate in dialogues about the notable figures and history behind the music.</p>

Also at the Blockson Collection is <a href="https://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage/event/lord-im-moving-celebrating"><em>Lord I’m Moving On: Celebrating the Great Migration</em></a>. This exhibition runs through January and tells the story of the Great Migration, with a special emphasis on Philadelphia. We encourage you to stop by the Blockson Collection to check out these exhibitions before the student performance.</p>
<p>The Music of the Great Migration is presented in collaboration with: the Philadelphia Jazz Project, Ars Nova Workshop, Boyer College of Music and Dance, and Scribe Video Center, with a special thanks to Terell Stafford, director of jazz studies and chair of instrumental studies at Boyer.</p>

Read on for a preview of our exciting lineup of programming for the upcoming academic year.</p>
<p><em>Visualizing Sustainability</em> is our series co-curated by Temple Contemporary and Temple University’s Office of Sustainability, as well as faculty and graduate students from the College of Liberal Arts and Tyler School of Art. This series will engage tangible, aesthetic, design, and activist practices that impact our environment. Look forward to discussions of food justice and activism, public art, bird migrations, and so much more.</p>
<p>The Libraries will also bring you a series around<em> Migrations</em>, with a particular focus on the music of the Great Migration. 2016 marks the 100th anniversary of this historic and culturally important movement of African Americans to the urban Northeast, Midwest, and West. We are partnering with the Philadelphia Jazz Project, Ars Nova, and the Boyer College of Music and Dance to bring you programs and exhibitions on John Coltrane, as well as public performances of John Coltrane’s music and other compositions of the time period.</p>
<p>All programs are free and open to all. Check out the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1467305887329000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHhl0lrLv5DthZHyqeXX0xN5D82gA">program schedule</a> as it becomes available and make sure to check back for updates and new programs as we move into fall.</p>

<p>Beginning this Thursday, April 21, Temple University Libraries’ <em><a href="http://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage">Beyond the Page</a></em> public programming series presents a hybrid live performance and interactive game experience, right in Temple’s Paley Library. Developed by three local artists—Joe Ahmed, Arianna Gass, and Daniel Park—and in collaboration with Drexel University’s <a href="http://egs.excite.drexel.edu/">Entrepreneurial Game Studio</a>, this hybrid work integrates elements of game design, physical theater, and dance and will have you looking at the library through different “eyes.”</p>
<p>The piece takes place in and around the library itself, and brings together theater and games in an active, public space. Daniel, one of the collaborators, finds the potential impacts of public play very exciting. “We get to examine the socially constructed rules that we’ve put on spaces, break them down, and decide which ones still feel important, and which ones are just silly. It’s especially great in Paley because while the ‘audience’ (meaning everyone else in the library) may not know what’s going on, they know there’s something weird, and it piques their interest, it gets them curious,” he says.</p>
<p>The creative team started the planning process last fall, and have been working on the project steadily since. Research helped them to “find artistic inspiration from the space the library, the library’s history, and Temple’s history,” according to Daniel. Consequently, Joseph Conwell’s <a href="https://www.temple.edu/about/history/acres-diamonds">&#8220;Acres of Diamonds&#8221;</a> plays prominently into the performance. The team then conducted a series of written and in-person interviews with library community members, which guided them in the creation phase. Here, they started to develop games and scenes which they formed into a coherent piece. This program is the first of its kind at Temple University Libraries, and is sure to be challenging, engaging, and fun.</p>
<p>Are you ready to be part of this unique experience? The performances run from Thursday, April 21 – Sunday, April 24, at 7:00 PM and 9:00 PM nightly. Register here: <a href="http://library.temple.edu/diamondeye/">http://library.temple.edu/diamondeye/</a>, where you will play through the first phase of the <em>Diamond Eye</em> game right online, and be immediately redirected to a registration link. Each performance hits capacity at 12 participants, so you will need to sign up ahead of time.</p>

This year’s theme is <a href="http://www.ilovelibraries.org/librariestransform/about">Libraries Transform</a>, which asks us all to think about the evolving role of libraries, as well as our own unique experiences with our libraries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some ways Temple University Libraries are celebrating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop by our table near the leisure reading section in Paley Library for more information about library resources and services, as well as some fun stress-relief activities, giveaways, and candy. The table will be staffed on Tuesday, April 12 and Thursday, April 14 from 2:00 – 4:00 PM.</li>
<li>Check out our trivia questions about library facts and figures on <a href="https://twitter.com/TempleLibraries?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter</a> and give us your best guesses!</li>
<li>Our Question of the Week board on the first floor of Paley Library asks how the Libraries have transformed YOU—what will you say?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In honor of National Library Week, we also asked what books or library resources Temple University Libraries’ staff members love. Here are some of their favorites—Enjoy!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">“My favorite library resource is our amazing <a href="http://library.temple.edu/collections/media/">Media Services</a> collection.” –Kathy Lehman, Supervisor, Access Services</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">“Perhaps my favorite book is <a href="http://diamond.temple.edu/record=b2676941~S30">Gabriel García Márquez’s <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em></a>. I used to re-read it every year or so, just to re-enter the magical-realist world of the Buendia family and the town of Macondo.” –Gary Kramer, Publicity Manager, Temple University Press</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">“One from my childhood comes to mind, and has stayed there through many decades: <a href="http://diamond.temple.edu/record=b4202916~S30"><em>The Secret Garden</em> by Frances Hodgson Burnett</a>. This was the only book my mother saved from her childhood, and it still sits safely on my bookshelf behind glass doors and surrounded by as many versions as I have been able to buy!” –Sandi Thompson, Head, Ambler Campus Library</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">“<a href="http://temple.naxosmusiclibrary.com/recentadditions.asp">Naxos Music Library</a> is a music streaming service, mostly classical music. I&#8217;ve used it since I was in undergrad, and there are recordings of lots of my favorite hard-to-find pieces in there. Another is <a href="http://comx.alexanderstreet.com/">Underground and Independent Comics, Comix, and Graphic Novels</a>. It has both primary-source content (digitized comic book issues), and scholarly articles and interviews about them. Plus, it lets you search by character and genre, which is pretty neat.” –Anastasia Chiu, Resident Librarian</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">“I suggest two films by Bob Fosse—<em><a href="http://diamond.temple.edu/record=b5606687~S30">Cabaret</a></em> and <em><a href="http://diamond.temple.edu/record=b5654509~S30">All That Jazz</a></em>. Media Services holds these films in their collections, as they are absolute classics of both cinema and performance. ” –Nicole Restaino, Manager for Library Communications and Public Programming</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">“Some of my favorite books are <em><a href="http://diamond.temple.edu/record=b5502010~S30">The Bell Jar</a>, <a href="http://diamond.temple.edu/record=b4202916~S30">The Secret Garden</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://diamond.temple.edu/record=b1605825~S30">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> trilogy.” –Fobazi Ettarh, Resident Librarian</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year, the Libraries bring you Film Fridays, a free series that aligns with our public programming theme. This year, we are examining games, gaming, and play, and we’ve chosen films for the spring semester that explore violence—both in games and real life. This frame will allow us to question and consider the influences media has on what we think about and how we relate to the world.<a href="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2016/03/ErnsteSpiele.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1988"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1988 alignright" src="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2016/03/ErnsteSpiele-300x146.jpg" alt="ErnsteSpiele" width="300" height="146" srcset="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2016/03/ErnsteSpiele-300x146.jpg 300w, https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2016/03/ErnsteSpiele-500x244.jpg 500w, https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2016/03/ErnsteSpiele.jpg 637w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Join us at the Libraries this <strong>Friday, March 11 at 3:00 PM</strong> for the latest installment of Gaming Film Fridays. We are screening the <em>Serious Games</em> series, which was directed by Harun Farocki and released in 2009 and 2010. The four short documentary films in this series explore intersections between gaming and the United States military, including the use of video games to train soldiers and how virtual reality can help treat post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>Nora Alter, professor of Film and Media Arts at Temple University, will be hand to introduce the film. Professor Alter has published extensively on film, media, and cultural studies, and one of her scholarly endeavors has been focused on Harun Faroki and his work. She knew Farocki personally and is currently working on a monograph about the late filmmaker. Her insight will surely set the stage for this thought-provoking and important documentary series.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Temple University Libraries is excited to welcome entrepreneur Ariell Johnson (FOX ’05) to campus on <strong>Tuesday, March 15</strong> to discuss geek culture and fan fiction, the grassroots literary genre in which fans create their own stories based on characters, series, and worlds that originate in science fiction, fantasy, gaming, and cult classic texts.</p>
<div id="attachment_1984" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2016/03/20160112_amalgam_002_1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1984"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1984" src="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2016/03/20160112_amalgam_002_1-300x150.jpg" alt="photo by Betsy Manning" width="300" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo by Betsy Manning</p></div>
<p>An alumna of the Fox School of Business, Johnson has truly embraced Temple University’s entrepreneurial spirit in opening her own local, small business—the new critically-acclaimed Amalgam Comics and Coffeehouse in the New Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Since Johnson opened the shop in December, her emphasis on creating a diverse and welcoming atmosphere for all kinds of “geeks” has generated considerable buzz in the city and beyond. She and her business have been profiled on NPR, NBC News, MTV News, The Mary Sue, Philly.com, and more.</p>
<p>Join us for a discussion with Johnson on <strong>Tuesday, March 15 at 2:30 PM in the Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong> located at 1210 Polett Walk in the center of Temple Main Campus.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">The week of February 22nd is <a href="http://fairuseweek.org/" target="_blank">Fair Use Week 2016</a> , a community celebration coordinated by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) to promote and discuss the importance of fair use doctrines. Fair use in the United States is tied to copyright laws and the accompanying exceptions that allow the use of copyrighted materials without permission. The principle of fair use creates a balance between honoring intellectual property rights and accommodating the flexible needs of academic settings and emerging technologies. While students, faculty, librarians, and community members may encounter questions related to use on a daily basis, this week exists to highlight issues, queries, and successes linked to using material fairly.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1966 alignright" src="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2016/02/ARL-FairUseWeek-Logo-Blue-300x232.jpg" alt="ARL-FairUseWeek-Logo-Blue" width="143" height="112" srcset="https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2016/02/ARL-FairUseWeek-Logo-Blue-300x232.jpg 300w, https://sites.temple.edu/libraryprograms/files/2016/02/ARL-FairUseWeek-Logo-Blue-388x300.jpg 388w" sizes="(max-width: 143px) 100vw, 143px" /></p>
<p>Temple University Libraries is joining in the conversation this week through screening a special webcast—<a href="http://library.temple.edu/about/programs#Partner" target="_blank">The Fair Use Factors: Their History and Application</a>. The program is presented by the Association of College &amp; Research Libraries, and our local, live viewing takes place <strong>Thursday, February 25 at 2:00 PM in the Tech Center, Conference Room 111</strong>. We invite you to join us!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve also compiled a list of resources from expert librarians and library staff for learning more about fair use. Check out the links below!</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Temple University Libraries, Research Guides, Fair Use</strong>: <a href="http://guides.temple.edu/c.php?g=348649&amp;p=2351948" target="_blank">http://guides.temple.edu/c.php?g=348649&amp;p=2351948</a><br />
The tab for fair use contains a number of good resources for learning about and applying the guidelines for these principles.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Fair Use Evaluator</strong>: <a href="http://librarycopyright.net/resources/fairuse/" target="_blank">http://librarycopyright.net/resources/fairuse/</a><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Copyright Advisory Network</strong>: <a href="http://librarycopyright.net/" target="_blank">http://librarycopyright.net/</a><br />
The American Library Association’s Office of Information Technology and Policy (OITP) interactive tools are clear and straightforward, offering answers about fair use, the public domain, as well as special exemptions in the law that cover the educational realm and copyright.</li>
</ul>
<p>—from Brian Boling, Media Services Librarian</p>

<li><strong>The Center for Media and Social Impact (CMSI) at American University</strong>: <a href="http://www.cmsimpact.org/fair-use" target="_blank">http://www.cmsimpact.org/fair-use</a><br />
My favorite resource for learning about fair use is the Center for Media and Social Impact (CMSI) at American University. Their website includes really useful information on best practices for documentary film, journalism, visual arts, and more. If you&#8217;re looking for real-world examples, check out their ‘Fair Use Question of the Month’ feature. Finally, CMSI has a great YouTube channel that includes over 100 videos about fair use.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Libraries are hosting a faculty and graduate teaching assistant workshop—“How to Use Wikipedia as a Teaching Tool”—next Monday, February 15.</p>
<p>We know that students use Wikipedia, but how can instructors use this same resource to engage students with media literacy, fact-based writing, research, collaboration, and critical thinking? At this workshop, staff from the Wiki Education Foundation will be on hand to discuss how students can improve existing articles through a classroom assignment, best practices for using Wikipedia as a teaching tool, and how Wiki Ed can support faculty and students.</p>
<p>In addition, 2016 is the Wikipedia Year of Science, so all faculty, particularly those in the sciences, will have the opportunity to speak with staff about how to participate in this exciting initiative.</p>
<p><strong>Please join us February 15 at the Paley Library Lecture Hall, 1210 Polett Walk, Ground Floor</strong> for what is sure to be an informative, engaging session. No RSVP is necessary, and please feel free to contact Steven Bell at bells@temple.edu with any questions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This spring, stop by the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection to view images of acclaimed American artist, Romare Bearden, by his friend and fellow artist, photographer Frank Stewart. Bearden, known for his collages and paintings, was also a prominent leader and mentor in the mid-twentieth century art scene in New York City. Stewart’s images offer an entry point into Bearden’s legacy while also serving as a historical record of the group of prominent artists and intellectuals with whom he maintained relationships. At the same time, Stewart offers us a warm portrait of Bearden’s life, at home and with friends.</p>

<p>The exhibit also features photos of Bearden from the John W. Mosley photograph collection. Mosley was a photographer who lived and worked along the east coast and whose images of African American life in mid-20th century Philadelphia are also housed in the Blockson Collection.</p>

This free event, now in its eighth year, inspires community members to gather at their local libraries one Saturday in November to read, learn, and play. The annual celebration includes special gaming programs and events, and reminds us that libraries serve as gathering places for all members of the community, and provide space for engagement, inspirations, ideas, and fun!</p>
<p>Check out the map for local, participating libraries in your area:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you know, Temple University Libraries are also invested in the community building, educational, and critical dimensions of games, gaming, and play. In fact, this year our <em>Beyond the Page</em> public programming series takes up those questions with our <em>Games Without Frontiers</em> curated, thematic events. The series has and will continue to explore gender and gaming, game design, the role of games in American leisure, and other important impacts of gaming culture. We are also using this frame as a metaphor for the ways in which chance, play, and algorithms appear in everyday life and guide our cultural systems. Stay on the lookout for updates about our spring programs and participate in a little gaming in the final days of fall semester. As we enter the end of semester rush, take a break at Paley Library’s <em>Crunch Time Café</em> for Craft n’ Games Night on Wednesday, November 9 between 5:00 PM and 10:00 PM in the Paley Library Lecture Hall.</p>

<p>Temple University Libraries is excited to welcome new media artist Angela Washko, a Tyler School of Art and Temple University Honors alumna, to campus<strong> November 5 </strong>and<strong> 6</strong>. Washko is currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University and has made a career of creating new forums for feminism in the spaces most hostile toward it. Her work has been featured in <em>Time Magazine</em>, <em>VICE</em>,<em> Hyperallergic</em>, and the <em>New York Times</em>, and she is also a recent recipient of The Franklin Furnace Performance Fund Grant, a Creative Time Report commission, a Rhizome Internet Art Microgrant, a Danish International Visiting Artist Grant and the Terminal Award. Her projects have been presented nationally and internationally at venues including Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art (Helsinki, Finland), Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, Moving Image Art Fair (London and NYC), and the Rotterdam International Film Festival.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Business is about relationships.” Says <a href="http://judywicks.com/about">Judy Wicks</a>, Founder of Philadelphia’s famous <a href="http://www.whitedog.com">White Dog Cafe</a> and pioneer of the local food movement. Fostering strong and empathetic relationships with employees, community, and the land are what Wicks credits as the foundation to her successful endeavors as both a business owner and a leader of national and local nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>On October 16<sup>th</sup>, Wicks was the latest speaker in Temple University Library’s fall 2013 “Beyond the Page” public program series <i>Gather Round the Table: Conversations on the History, Impact and Implications of Food in Our Society</i>. In her presentation “Good Morning, Beautiful business” (named for the title of her <a href="http://judywicks.com/book/">recent memoir</a>), Wicks shared her story of compassionate economics based in empathy and respect for world around her.</p>
<p>Wicks’ story begins in University City circa 1970, when her and her then-husband Dick Haynes founded The Free People Store, a retail establishment specializing in locally sourced merchandise and decorated using recycled goods to create a DIY/earth-friendly aesthetic. Though Wicks and Haynes would split only a year later (Haynes would go on to expand the Free People brand to create the <a href="http://urbn.com">Urban Outfitters retail empire</a>), it took only a short time for her to become involved in the local restaurant scene, eventually opening The White Dog Café on the ground floor of her home in 1983.</p>
<p>Witnessing the negative effects that the practices of national chains were having on the local economy, Wicks set out to create a business that was their antitheses, working to create a business with deep and sustainable roots in Philadelphia and in her University City community. This manifested itself as a commitment to living wages, humanely sourced food, local beverage (The White Dog Café was a pioneer in Philadelphia’s now-famous craft beer scene), and community outreach. In the case of the latter, The White Dog Café regularly held open holiday celebrations, educational public presentations, and workshops organized in tandem with West Philadelphia High School to create an awareness of sustainable nutrition in the community.</p>
<p>Wicks’ civic focus eventually expanded to activism beyond the White Dog Café to a national level. In 2009 Wicks sold the Café to focus on several nonprofit organizations devoted to sustainable and local businesses: the national <a href="http://bealocalist.org">Business Alliance for Local Living Economies</a> (BALLE), <a href="http://www.sbnphiladelphia.org">The Sustainable Business Network of Philadelphia</a>, and <a href="http://www.fairfoodphilly.org">Fair Food</a>. The spirit of these organizations of these, Wicks says, is to help businesses to make decisions that are a marriage of the heart and the head, allowing them to profit while responsibly serving and interacting with the community.</p>
<p>“Good Morning, Beautiful Business” is a reminder that values need not be left at home. By fostering real and meaningful relationships in business, Wicks is an example of how this phrase can be taken beyond the page and used to create business that can strengthen our relationships with both each other and the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is it about Walt Whitman that keeps us wondering? His intrigue goes so far beyond those iconic poems, like <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, that great work of American literature and innovation. He is a, poet, iconoclast, voice of democracy, voice of dissent, queer writer, and American celebrity.</p>
<p>On Thursday we’ll mark National Library Week and National Poetry month by pondering Whitman’s long-reaching legacy with David Haven Blake and Michael Robertson, two professors of English at the College of New Jersey. Katherine Henry, professor of English here at Temple, will ask questions and guide the conversation.</p>
<p>Both Haven Blake and Robertson consider not just Whitman’s poetry, but his cultural legacy, as well. The scholars are co-editors of <i>Walt Whitman, Where the Future Becomes Present </i>(University of Iowa Press, 2008). The book invigorates Whitman studies by garnering insights from a diverse group of writers and intellectuals. Writing from the perspectives of art history, political theory, creative writing, and literary criticism, the contributors place Whitman in the center of both world literature and American public life.</p>
<p>Blake is also the author of <i>Walt Whitman and the Culture of American Celebrity </i>(Yale University Press, 2006). Robertson is the recipient of two National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowships and author of <i>Worshipping Walt: The Whitman Disciples</i> (Princeton UP, 2008).</p>
<p><strong>Join us for the conversation </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thursday, April 18, 3:30 pm, Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, March 7 the Center for the Humanities at Temple&#8217;s series on Digital Humanities, co-sponsored by Temple University Libraries, will continue at the CHAT lounge in Gladfelter Hall. Kathleen Fitzpatrick, professor of Media Studies at Pomona College and Director of Scholarly Communications at the MLA will discuss &#8220;The Humanities in and for the Digital Age.&#8221; Dr. Fitzpatrick will address how digital technologies have rapidly changed the landscape of scholarly publishing, and how they have equally changed the ways that scholars themselves engage with their work. This talk explores a few of those changes as they have begun to affect the humanities, including the new roles being played by scholarly societies in today&#8217;s communication environment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is an American Main Street? Is it a memory or image that has been perpetuated through American writing and art? A real space within new urbanist town planning? Or is it a place where some are welcome and others are shunned? Perhaps it is all of the above.</p>
<p>Distinguished Temple professor <a href="http://www.temple.edu/english/people/faculty/orvell.html">Miles Orvell</a> and photographer <a href="http://sandysorlien.com/">Sandy Sorlien</a> will take on these questions, and more, at an interdisciplinary conversation on American Main Streets at Paley Lecture Hall on 2/21, 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>When asked about the importance of main streets to planning and sustainability, Sorlien, who has been advocating for walkable downtowns for the past decade, stated &#8220;the importance of the traditional Main Street is that it is the essential center of a walkable<br />
village or urban neighborhood. You can&#8217;t have walkability without  useful destinations  (shops, offices, civic functions), and without  walkability the place depends on cars, which further damage walkability, at least the way we&#8217;ve designed cities for many decades.&#8221; She also adds that &#8220;It&#8217;s important to understand Main Streets as essential to great  cities, not just quaint little rural towns.  Philadelphia&#8217;s mixed-use  corridors knit our many neighborhoods together, which then enables  transit. It&#8217;s all connected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her photographic practice reflects her interest in these spaces, and she has been photographing landscapes and townscapes since 1980. She has published her work in <a href="http://sandysorlien.com/fifty/fifty.htm"><em>Fifty Houses: Images from the American Road</em></a> (Johns Hopkins 2002), and is finishing a book about Main Streets in America with the working title<em> The Heart of Town</em>.</p>
<p>Dr. Miles Orvell, professor of English and American Studies here at Temple, is equally interested in main streets, and his innovative, interdisciplinary research approaches questions of space and the built environment through a number of theoretical, visual, and historiographic methods.</p>
<p>In the last five years, Orvell has focused his research on the cultural meaning of<br />
place, and he has co-edited a collection of essays,<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ideology-American-Culture-Architecture-Technology/dp/9042025743">Public Space and the Ideology of Place in American Culture</a> </em>(Rodopi, 2009). He is an editor of the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/series.html#ATC">University of Pennsylvania Press series, <em>Architecture, Technology, Culture</em>,</a> and is co-editing<br />
a volume in the series, <em>Thinking Architecture, Technology, Culture</em>, based on a<br />
conference he helped organize in Munich.</p>
<p>His most recent book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Death-Life-Main-Street/dp/0807835684"><em>The Death and Life of Main Street: Small Towns in American<br />
Memory, Space, and Community</em></a> (University of North Carolina Press, 2012), which<br />
recovers the complex and contradictory cultural meanings of the small town at the<br />
same time that it problematizes the icon of Main Street. He is presently working<br />
on a book on photography, ruins, and contemporary culture, called “The Course of<br />
Empire: American Photography and the Destructive Sublime.”</p>
<p>Join us to examine these real and imagined notions of American main streets with Miles Orvell and Sandy Sorlien. We hope to see you at Paley Library Lecture Hall on Thursday, February 21 at 2:30 PM to join in the conversation!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Envisioning Emancipation</em>, by Deborah Willis and Barbara Krauthamer and published by Temple University Press, is quickly gaining attention as an important and innovative text on the power of photography in the journey to emancipation. In this pioneering book, the authors have amassed 150 photographs—some never before published—from the antebellum days of the 1850s through the New Deal era of the 1930s. They vividly display the seismic impact of emancipation on African Americans born before and after the Proclamation, providing a perspective on freedom and slavery and a way to understand the photos as documents of engagement, action, struggle, and aspiration.</p>
<p>Press coverage has included extensive write ups by the <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/images-of-emancipation/"><em>New York Times</em> Lens blog</a> to an <a href="http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/01/150-years-later-myths-persist-about-the-emancipation-proclamation/">interview and photogallery</a> on CNN.com. Among those to laud the book&#8217;s efforts are Thelma Golden, the chief curator and director of the Studio Museum of Harlem and reviewers at Publisher&#8217;s Weekly.</p>
<p>Krauthamer and Willis will be on campus for a book talk, signing and reception on Friday, February 8. The program takes place at 3PM in the Great Court of Mitten Hall (1931 N. Broad Street).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Libraries are now finalizing our <a href="http://library.temple.edu/about/programs">spring public programming &#8220;Beyond the Page&#8221; series. Once again this semester&#8217;s talks, panels, lectures, and programs explore the &#8220;American Idea.&#8221;</a> The series kicks off on Friday, February 8 at the Great Court in Mitten Hall with a book talk by Deborah Willis and Barbara Krauthamer on their recent publication, <a href="http://library.temple.edu/highlights/public-programs-february-8">Envisioning Emancipation</a>. Other programs include conversations on American main streets, American drinking traditions, and a special National Library Week program on Walt Whitman, American Icon. We will also have exhibitions on civil rights activist and Philadelphia hero, Father Paul Washington (at the Blockson Collection) and American Poetry (at Paley Library).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s all of what we&#8217;ve got to offer this spring:</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1><em><strong>Spring 2013 Public Programs</strong></em></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong><em>Envisioning Emancipation</em>: A Book Talk and Signing With Deb Willis and Barbara Krauthamer</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>February 8, 3:00 PM, Mitten Hall, Great Court, 1913 N. Broad Street</strong></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">In their pioneering book, <em>Envisioning Emancipation</em>, renowned photographic historian Deborah Willis and historian of slavery Barbara Krauthamer have amassed 150 photographs—some never before published—from the antebellum days of the 1850s through the New Deal era of the 1930s. The authors vividly display the seismic impact of emancipation on African Americans born before and after the Proclamation, providing a perspective on freedom and slavery and a way to understand the photos as documents of engagement, action, struggle and aspiration. <em>Envisioning Emancipation</em> illustrates what freedom looked like for black Americans in the Civil War era. From photos of the enslaved on plantations and African American soldiers and camp workers in the Union Army to Juneteenth celebrations, slave reunions and portraits of black families and workers in the American South, the images in this book challenge perceptions of slavery. They show not only what the subjects emphasized about themselves but also the ways Americans of all colors and genders opposed slavery and marked its end. Filled with powerful images of lives too often ignored or erased from historical records, <em>Envisioning Emancipation</em>provides a new perspective on American culture.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>On American Main Streets: A Conversation with Miles Orvell and Sandy Sorlien</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>February 21, 2:30 PM, Paley Library Lecture Hall 1210 Polett Walk</strong></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">What is an American Main Street? Is it a memory or image that has been perpetuated through American writing and art? A real space within new urbanist town planning? Or is it a place where some are welcome and others are shunned? Perhaps it is all of the above. Join us to examine these real and imagined notions of American main streets with Miles Orvell and Sandy Sorlien. Orvell is the author of <em>The Death and Life of Main Street: Small Towns in American Memory, Space, and Community </em>(University of North Carolina Press 2012) and professor of English and American studies at Temple. In 2009, he received the Bode-Pearson Prize for lifetime achievement, awarded by the American Studies Association.

<h2><strong>Drinking History: How Beverages have Changed America</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>March 26, 3:30 PM, Paley Library Lecture Hall, 1210 Polett Walk</strong> What is American drink? Is it warmed-over traditional British beverages, such as tea and ale? Or is it versions of ethnic beverages brought by successive waves of immigrants—sangria, tequila, bubble tea? Or is it the fiercely marketed creations of America’s beverage industry—Kool-Aid, Snapple, Coors, Coca-Cola? Andrew F. Smith, author of the just released <em>Drinking History: 15 Turning Points in the Making of American Beverages</em> (Columbia University Press) will discuss how beverages have changed American history and how Americans have invented, adopted, modified, and commercialized tens of thousands of beverages. Involved in their creation and promotion were entrepreneurs and environmentalists, bartenders and bottlers, politicians and lobbyists, organized and unorganized criminals, German and Italian immigrants, advertisers and consumers, prohibitionists and medical professionals, and everyday Americans in love with their brew.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Walt Whitman: An American Icon</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>April 18, 3:30 PM, Paley Library Lecture Hall, 1210 Polett Walk</strong></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Walt Whitman’s legacy—iconoclast, celebrity, and the father of American poetry—is unparalleled in its influence on American writing and culture. Join David Haven Blake and Michael Robertson, professors of English at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) and co-editors of <em>Walt Whitman, Where the Future Becomes Present to discuss the impact that Whitman has had on American culture—an impact that reaches far beyond his influence on poetry. Blake is also the chair of the English Department at TCNJ, and author of Walt Whitman and the Culture of American Celebrity. Robertson </em>is the recipient of two National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowships and author of the award-winning book <em>Worshipping Walt: The Whitman Disciples</em> (Princeton UP, 2008). This program will be moderated by Katherine Henry, associate professor of English at Temple.</p>

<p><strong>The American Idea of Public Design: The Street as Place</strong></p>
<p><strong>November 8, 3:30 PM, Paley Library Lecture Hall<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please join us as journalists, critics and designers examine <em>The American Idea of Public Design.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Panelists include Inga Saffron, architecture critic for the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>; Hilary Jay, founder of DesignPhiladelphia and critic, curator and former design journalist for the <em>Inquirer Sunday Magazine</em>; Diana Lind, Editor in Chief of the <em>Next American City</em>; and designer and architect, Bryan Hanes.</strong></p>
<p>The American Idea of Public Design: The Street as Place, co-presented by Temple University Libraries and DesignPhiladelphia in partnership with The University of the Arts, will explore design at street level. How do objects on the street – the props that surround us as we come, go, and linger – affect the quality of our experience and the livability of the city?</p>
<p>Join us as we rethink everything from the design and amenities of a new park to the functionality of public trashcans. We’ll consider street trees and sidewalk planters, bus shelters, public seating, newspaper stands, the facades of buildings and storefronts of businesses, crosswalks, streetlights, and more. The program will feature Bryan Hanes, Landscape Architect and Urban Designer; Diana Lind, Executive Director and Editor in Chief of <em>Next American City</em>; and Inga Saffron, Architecture Critic at <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em>. Hilary Jay, Founding Director of DesignPhiladelphia, will moderate.</p>
<p>The discussion is co-presented by Temple University Libraries and DesignPhiladelphia, part of Temple&#8217;s Beyond the Page series shaped around the theme, &#8220;American Idea.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Connection between Open Access and Open Educational Resources: Exploring New Publishing Models</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 24, 3:30 PM, Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong></p>
<p>The week of October 22, 2012 marks <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a>, a global event now entering its sixth year. It is an opportunity for the academic and research community to continue to learn about the potential benefits of Open Access, to share what they’ve learned with colleagues, and to help inspire wider participation in helping to make Open Access a new norm in scholarship and research.</p>
<p>Temple University Libraries will join in the festivities this year by bringing to campus two nationally recognized speakers who will share their expertise to create greater awareness about the current issues in open access and open educational resources. Both open access and open educational resources are movements designed to encourage the open sharing of academic content. Be it scholarly research or academic textbooks, scholars are increasingly becoming aware that there are multiple options for sharing their knowledge in ways that make it more openly accessible to the public.</p>
<p>To help our community better understand the issues we’ll be hearing from <strong>Nick Shockey</strong>,  SPARC’s (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) first director of student advocacy and Director of the Right to Research Coalition, and <strong>Nicole Allen</strong>, the Student Public Interest Research Groups Textbook Advocate and director of the Make Textbooks Affordable project. Since 2007, she has worked with students, faculty and decision-makers across the country to address the rapidly rising cost of college textbooks through grassroots organizing, public education and advocacy.  Nationally recognized as a leading issue expert, Ms. Allen&#8217;s research and opinions have been cited in numerous publications including <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>USA Today</em>.</p>
<p>Please join us on Wednesday, October 24 at 3:30 pm in the Paley Library Lecture Hall as we celebrate Open Access Week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A national election is approaching&#8230;.please join us to consider<strong> The American Idea on Politics in a Conversation with Keya Dannenbaum and Hal Gullan, hosted by Robin Kolodny<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 23, 2:00 PM, Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong></p>
<p>As another presidential election approaches, politics are on our minds. America’s founding values of freedom and democracy play out in intriguing ways in the 21<sup>st</sup> century media-saturated environment. In a world of sound bites, electoral fights, and bipartisan snipes, how can we best participate in a democracy and vote on the issues that are important to us? Panelists Keya Dannenbaum and Hal Gullan will discuss those questions and more on October 23 at Paley.</p>
<p><em>Dannenbaum</em> is the founder of electnext.com, a site that translates political data into tools that help build a more informed, engaged, and effective democracy. Dannenbaum has studied and worked in politics from a variety of perspectives:  as a Stanford undergrad and Princeton Ph.D.; internationally as a Fulbright Scholar in Colombia and later in India; nationally in the 2008 Presidential election; and locally for the Mayor of New Haven, CT.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Libraries are delighted to continue their relationship with Temple Contemporary (formerly Temple Gallery) by co-sponsoring three programs this fall. These programs represent our commitments to bringing speakers, arts, and culture, in a variety of disciplines, to the Temple campus.</p>
<p>All programs take place at Temple Contemporary in the Tyler School of Art building, 2001 North 13th Street, and all require<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/org/2593844698?s=9812126"> free registration. </a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://billlabov.eventbrite.com/">Thursday, September 20 @ 7PM at Temple Contemporary we welcome renowned linguist William Labov.  </a></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How does Philadelphian differ from other dialects across the United States? Learn about Philadelphia’s place in American English with internationally renowned linguist <a href="http://templecontemporary.createsend1.com/t/j-l-gkihrd-l-u/"><strong>William Labov</strong></a>.  What natural misunderstandings stem from the Philadelphia dialect and how is our accent changing in response to higher education and immigration?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Come early to test your linguistic knowledge with an interactive language display designed by Hive76 that features accents from across Philadelphia and the United States.  Also on display will be linguistically related works by <a href="http://templecontemporary.createsend1.com/t/j-l-gkihrd-l-o/"><strong>Rachel Perry Welty</strong></a> and <a href="http://templecontemporary.createsend1.com/t/j-l-gkihrd-l-b/"><strong>Sean Monahan</strong></a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">William Labov is a University of Pennsylvania linguist who has been studying the Philadelphia dialect for the past 25 years.  Widely regarded as the founder of variationist sociolinguistics, his 1960s studies of African American Vernacular English remain some of the most respected linguistic research of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The Changing Patterns of Philadelphia English is scheduled to address questions of how Philadelphia talks to itself that were raised by Temple Contemporary’s Advisory Council.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This event is co-sponsored through generous support of Temple University’s Departments of Spanish and Portuguese, Temple University Libraries, Anthropology, American Studies, Geography and Urban Studies, General Student Activities Fund, and Tyler School of Art.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://irvingsandler.eventbrite.com/">Thursday, October 18 @ 6PM, world renowned critic Irving Sandler comes to campus</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In partnership with the Art History, and Painting Departments at Tyler School of Art, Temple Contemporary is proud to welcome back Temple alumnus and renowned art critic Irving Sandler.  Nationally regarded as one of the most influential writers of the New York art scene, Irving Sandler’s books including The Triumph of American Painting: A History of Abstract Expressionism (1970), The New York School: The Painters and Sculptors of the Fifties (1978), American Art of the 1960s (1988), Art of the Postmodern Era: From the Late 1960s to the Early 1990s (1996) stand as the most lucid and critical examinations of the New York art world ever written.<br />
Sandler will be specifically addressing the radical change that took place across the United States and specifically in the art world in the early 1970s.  This shift created the distinction that is now recognized as the development from Modernism to Post-Modernism.  Sandler&#8217;s illustrated lecture will be positioning this change into an historical context of cultural and political events that continue to be relevant to the discourse of contemporary art.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Irving Sandler&#8217;s visit is part of The Department of Art History&#8217;s Distinguished Art History Alumni and Scholar Lecture Series.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This lecture is co-sponsored by Temple University Libraries, The Art History Department, The Department of Painting, Drawing, and Sculpture, Temple University General Activities Fees, Temple Contemporary.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://theglobalstreet.eventbrite.com/">Tuesday, October 23 @ 7PM Saskia Sassen visits Temple Contemporary</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As the oldest street and square grid in the United States, Philadelphia has long been an active participant in the “rhetorical and operational openings” enabled by city public spaces.  On a macro level of media visibility- urban streets have become global stages for enacting political change.  However, on a micro level many of these same urban thoroughfares have themselves been engineered to segregate communities leading to increased civic unrest, economic disinvestment in urban centers, and a booming car culture.  How can we reconcile the uses of urban streets to collapse these disparities of scale?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Saskia Sassen will be addressing the question of how we can best occupy “the global street” for civic, environmental, political, and economic global gain.  Sassen, Robert S. Lynd Professor of Sociology at Columbia University, is one of the world’s leading authorities on the social consequences of globalization. Her meticulous and far-reaching work has encompassed immigration, new networked technologies, the dynamics of global cities, the changes within the nation-state caused by the “transnational” economy and the feminization of labor. Her work is characterized by the “unexpected and the counter-intuitive”, and she uses her research to cut through established “truths” that may not be what they seem.</p>
<p><em>The Global Street</em> is co-organized by Temple Contemporary and Next American City.  This event is sponsored by Temple University’s Film and Media Arts Department and Temple University Libraries.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>LECTURE&#8211;The American Gallerist:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sande Webster on 40 Years with Art and Artists</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXHIBITION—<em>Sande Webster Presents 4 x 10, the Work of Ten American Artists</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>October 5, Lecture, 3:00 PM, Art Sale and Exhibition, 4:30 PM</strong></p>
<p><em>Program and Exhibition will both take place in Paley Library Lecture Hall</em></p>
<p>Join us for a conversation with pioneering gallerist Sande Webster as she discusses her more than forty years of experience with art, artists, and the cultural scene in Philadelphia. Webster has enacted her philosophy of diversity at the Sande Webster Gallery, originally Wallnuts, Inc. She was also amongst the first in Philadelphia to display photography, glass, clay, and textiles in a fine art environment. She has also long been an advocate of African American artists, and says, “[I]ndeed, with the passing of Kenmore Gallery, we were alone among the commercial galleries to exhibit the extraordinary talents of numerous African American artists, who, along with the ‘white’ painters, sculptors and printmakers were making a stir among the cognoscenti in and out of the city. Unfortunately, more than thirty years later not much has changed.” A true trailblazer, Sande joins us for Homecoming Weekend to share her ideas on art.</p>
<p>After the program, join us for an exhibition and sale, <em>Sande Webster Presents 4 x10, the Work of Ten American Artists</em>. Works by noted Philadelphia talents in mediums including painting, sculpture and photography will be for sale and featured during this show. Artists partaking are: Andrea Baldeck, James Brantley, Moe Brooker, Miguel Antonio Horn, Brian Dennis, Arlene Love, John McDaniel, Kathleen Spicer, Ron Tarver, and Mark Wallison.</p>
<p><em>For more than four decades, Sande Webster has been a torch on the Philadelphia art scene&#8230;.[S]he has been a force for the commercial exhibition of photography, ceramics and textiles as art, and—perhaps most notably—has provided an uninterrupted outlet for the work of African American artists. —Philadelphia Inquirer</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The American Idea on Sports and Race: A Conversation with Larry Lester and Rebecca Alpert<br />
October 2, 3:30 PM<br />
Baseball—the great American pastime—also serves as a lens through which to explore and examine broader American ideas on race, heroes and popular culture. Join Larry Lester, a co-founder of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, and Rabbi Rebecca Alpert, associate professor of religion at Temple University and author of <em>Out of Left Field: Jews and Black Baseball</em> (Oxford University Press, 2011), to discuss the history of race and baseball. Lester has served as a curator and consultant at numerous cultural institutions, including the African American Museum in Dallas, Texas, and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y. Lester authored<em> The Negro Leagues Book</em> (Society for American Baseball Research, 1994), which has been called “the most complete collection of information on . . . the Negro Leagues ever published.” Alpert has published several journal articles on Jews and baseball, was featured as an expert commentator in the film, Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story (Willow Pond Films, 2010, directed by Peter Miller), and is frequently consulted by the press on the subject. Both Lester and Alpert name Jackie Robinson as a hero and inspiration.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps the phrase that best describes the 21st century city is “constant evolution.” The diversity of arts, business, architecture, and people, the dynamism between city planning, politics and neighborhoods—these elements constantly shift and interact to make a city unique. Temple University Libraries will explore the many elements that comprise today’s city from a variety of perspectives: academics, authors, artists, citizens, planners, civic leaders, preservationists and more. At the center of this semester-long exploration will be a symposium with Temple’s General Education program, and a number of speakers, events and activities that explore the complex, contemporary city. Explore “the city” this spring at Temple University Libraries.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Paley Library Lecture Hall<br />
1210 Polett Walk</strong></p>
<p>Martin R. Delany was one of the first to challenge the paradigm of White Supremacy. Delany said, &#8220;Every people should be originators of their own destiny.&#8221; He not only challenged slavery, he challenged the very thinking that allowed slavery to exist.</p>
<p>Join the Libraries and Moonstone Arts Center for a talk on the importance of Delany, the father of Black Nationalism, with scholar Molefi Kete Asante. Dr. Asante is Professor in the Department of African American Studies at Temple University. He has published 70 books, and, in 1987, he established the nation&#8217;s first doctoral program in African American Studies</p>

The Wagner Free Institute of Science, Located at 1700 West Montgomery Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19121</strong></p>
<p>We often see debates between experts on scientific issues that affect our lives and livelihoods. What can we do when the experts disagree but their decisions have enormous impacts on us? Do we try to influence their debate? Do we trust one side? Do we trust our gut feelings? Hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale has brought up these questions and issues. Join us for a panel discussion with speakers from a number of fields and disciplines who will help us understand the way we access and understand information and help us apply lessons learned from history in our decision-making process.</p>
<p><em>Moderator:</em><br />
Babak Ashrafi, Executive Director of the Philadelphia Area Center for History of Science</p>
<p><em>Panel:</em><br />
Susan Phillips, Reporter for WHYY and NPR, contributor to State Impact PA<br />
Brook Lenker, Director of Fractracker.org<br />
Sara Wylie, Director of Toxics and Health Research, publiclaboratory.org</p>
<p><em>The second annual Philadelphia Science Festival, taking place April 20-29, is presented by The Dow Chemical Company to celebrate science and technology.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TOM FINKELPEARL ON PUBLIC ART April 17, 2:30 PM, Paley Library</strong>  Public art has a way of sparking discussion and community action. Sometimes controversial, sometimes intriguing and sometimes aesthetically displeasing, public art exists in almost every city and town. Join Tom Finkelpearl in a discussion on the process behind these sometimes divisive, sometimes unifying artworks that reside in the public sphere. Tom Finkelpearl is currently the director of the Queens Museum of Art, and is a foremost expert on public art. He has approached the topic from nearly every angle: as an administrator while directing NYC’s Percent for Art Fund, as a practicing artist in New York, and as a scholar and author of Dialogues in Public Art (MIT Press). Join him at Paley Library to discuss public art, and the role public arts projects play in planning and defining our cities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Centennial Celebrations in the City Philadelphia, Historical Memory and America’s Biggest Birthday Parties</strong></h2>
<p><strong> March 28, 2:30 PM, Paley Library</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/193266860787395/">REGISTER ON FACEBOOK</a> 1876 and 1976 saw the launch of two massive national celebrations originating right here in Philadelphia. In 1876 we hosted America’s first World’s Fair, timed with the nation’s centennial celebration. And, one hundred years later we did it all over again to celebrate America’s bicentennial birthday. Come discuss the impact these celebrations had on Philadelphia and what large, national celebrations have to say about our culture with scholars Malgorzata Rymsza-Pawlowska and Susanna Gold. Gold received her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania. Her dissertation is “Imaging Memory: Re-Presentations of the Civil War at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition,” and she currently teaches here at Temple in the Tyler School of Art. Rymsza-Pawlowska is a doctoral candidate at Brown University, working on a her project, “Bicentennial Memory: Postmodernity, Media, and Historical Subjectivity in the United States, 1966-1980.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Susanna Gold </strong>is Assistant Professor of 19th and 20th century Art History at the Tyler School of Art, Temple University, specializing in Exhibition Theory and Race Politics. She earned her MA from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and her Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, where she wrote her dissertation on the American Art at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition. She has held research fellowships at the Penn Humanities Forum, the Winterthur Museum, the Library Company of Philadelphia and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and has given talks at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Union League Club of Philadelphia, Payne Theological Seminary in Ohio, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts in Maryland, the Ackland Art Museum in North Carolina, and a number of professional conferences. She is currently at work on her book on the 1876 Centennial Exhibition for Penn State University Press.<br />
<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Malgorzata Rymsza-Pawlowska</strong> is completing her PhD at Brown University. Her dissertation, “Bicentennial Memory: Postmodernity, Media, and Historical Subjectivity in the United States, 1966-1980,” will be completed in 2012. It examines historicity and historical subjectivity in the 1970s, arguing that this moment saw a profound change in the way that individuals, organizations, and the state conceived of and interacted with the American past, reflecting a broad shift from a cultural logic of preservation to one of reenactment. Gosia received her B.A. in American History and Sociology from Barnard College, an M.A. in Cultural and Media Studies at Georgetown University and an M.A. in Public Humanities from Brown University. She is currently a Smithsonian Predoctoral Fellow.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Join us for the March 2012 installment of Chat in the Stacks, as Temple scholars explore: &#8220;Is Education Under Assault&#8221; ? Faculty panelists include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Matt Tincani</strong> Profressor Tincani is an Associate Professor of Special Education at Temple and coordinator of the Master&#8217;s Degree Program in Applied Behavior Analysis. His research interests focus on teaching language and social skills to people with autism spectrum disorder, positive behavior support, and applied behavior analysis. He is author of numerous journal articles, book chapters, and books on these topics, including &#8220;Preventing Challenging Behavior: Positive Behavior Support and Effective Classroom Management&#8221; (Prufrock Press, 2011).He is also interested in how policy informs the education of children with with ASD and other disabilities in public schooling.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yasuko Kanno</strong> Professor Kanno is an Associate Professor of TESOL in the College of Education, Temple University. She is interested in linguistic minority students’ negotiation of identity and educational opportunities within institutional settings, and this interest has resulted in two books, Negotiating Bilingual and Bicultural Identities (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003) and Language and Education in Japan (Palgrave, 2008). Yasuko is currently working on several projects on linguistic minority students’ access to college, including statistical analyses of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), and an ethnographic study of linguistic minority high school seniors going to college. Her latest work is Linguistic Minority Students Go to College: Preparation, Access, and Persistence (with Linda Harklau, Routledge, 2012). As a teacher educator, she teaches a variety of TESOL courses, including an undergraduate introductory course in English Language Learner Education, graduate courses in sociopolitical aspects of language teaching and learning, bilingual education and bilingualism, and language teaching methods. At home, she is the mom of an energetic and incredibly social 8-year-old son.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maia Bloomfield Cucchiara</strong> Professor Bloomfield Cucchiara is a sociologist of education focusing on urban education policy. My research examines urban education policy and its implications for disadvantaged students. I do this in two distinct ways. First, I am interested in understanding the impact urban revitalization and redevelopment have on public schools. My research in this area is designed to provide an understanding of the relationship between public education and deindustrialization, urban revitalization, and other macro-level urban processes. What role do schools play in 21st century cities? How do processes such as urban transformation and gentrification affect policy and practice in public schools? In particular, I am interested in the extent to which these developments ameliorate or exacerbate existing inequalities between students, families, and schools. Second, I am interested in school reform in Philadelphia and its implications for equity and capacity. Much of my work on Philadelphia school reform has examined the ways the state takeover of Philadelphia’s schools and the resulting marketization of the district affected civic engagement and civic capacity around education. I have published in the American Educational Research Journal, Teachers College Record, and the Journal of Education Policy.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PLACE X PROMISE=PHILADELPHIA: Philadelphia and the makeshift metropolis  March 20, 11:00 AM, Kiva Auditorium  A Symposium Program by the General Education Program and Temple University Libraries</strong>  Architect, urbanist and University of Pennsylvania’s Professor Witold Rybczynski shares ideas from his recent book <em>Makeshift Metropolis</em> and discusses them within the Philadelphia context. Traditional city planning has important lessons to offer, but after more than a century of big ideas that falter, Rybczynski argues, we’ve learned that cities may actually thrive best on a myriad of smaller ideas.  Joining the discussion with Rybczynski is a distinguished panel (Paul Levy, President and CEO of the Center City District; Sandra Shea, Opinion Page Editor of the <em>Philadelphia Daily News</em>; and Temple Professor Carolyn Adams)  who will ground the promise of urban place by introducing Philadelphia examples.</p>

His photography captures commercial, cultural and government buildings left vacant throughout Philadelphia. He has also worked on photography projects focusing on the built and natural environments of the Gulf Coast, the Ivy League schools and overseas, in Europe, Japan and China.

His work has been exhibited in solo exhibitions in Philadelphia at the Paley Design Center and the Open Lens Gallery at the Gershman Y, and in group exhibitions at Moore College of Art &amp; Design, the Allentown Art Museum, the Philadelphia Art Alliance and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Feldman received his BFA from George Washington University and his MFA from Tyler School of Art. His work is in the collections of the Allentown Art Museum, the Free Library of Philadelphia, Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, Zeit-Foto Salon and KOWA, Tokyo. Feldman was awarded Pew Fellowship in 2001. He is currently a Master Lecturer at the University of the Arts and Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tyler School of Art and Philadelphia University.</p>

<p><strong>February 28, 2:30 PM, Paley Library</strong></p>
<p>Join us to watch <em>The City Dark</em>, filmmaker Ian Cheney’s exploration of how we, as dwellers of contemporary cities, relate to the night sky. After moving to light-polluted New York City from rural Maine, he asks: “Do we need the dark?” Exploring the threat of killer asteroids in Hawai’i, tracking hatching turtles along the Florida coast, and rescuing injured birds on Chicago streets, Cheney unravels the myriad implications of a globe glittering with lights. After the film, enjoy refreshments and a participate in a panel with Cheney and Temple scholars Barry Vacker of BTMM and Jonathan deJonge of Community and Regional Planning.</p>
<ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This spring the book club will explore the city, addressing immigration and city life through a discussion of Edwidge Danticat’s <em>Create Dangerously: The Immigrant Artist at Work</em> and Witold Rybczynski’s <em>City Life</em>. Join us for discussion and refreshments this spring at Paley.   <em>Create Dangerously</em> is MacArthur Genius Grant winner Edwidge Danticat’s collection of essays takes its name from Albert Camus&#8217;s last published lecture in which he stated, &#8220;To create today is to create dangerously.&#8221; The book illustrates the struggle of making art in exile—and what it&#8217;s like to exist in a country constantly in conflict, where even the act of reading means taking a stand against oppression.  This book is the official <a href="http://libwww.freelibrary.org/onebook/obop12/index.cfm">One Book, One Philadelphia </a> selection in this, the program&#8217;s 10th year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What does it take to publish successful music writing today? How do you follow the music scene in the age of basement shows, MySpace and internet memes? Where do you begin to gain access to bands, and what is the value of publishing print magazines in an information universe of blogs, tumblrs and YouTube? The founders and editors of some of today’s most influential and interesting music journalism projects will answer these questions, and more, at Paley Library.</p>
<p><strong>Stick around for the JUMP November release party at 5:30 in the Lecture Hall Free food and free music with Turning Violet Violet and Bedroom Problems</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=209358992470106">Register on facebook</a> and while you are there&#8230;.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Temple-University-Libraries/6340283058">&#8220;like&#8221; us too!</a></p>
<p><strong>George Miller </strong>is an assistant professor of journalism at Temple University and the founder of <em>JUMP: The Philly Music Project</em>, a magazine dedicated to music makers of all genres who hail from and create music exclusively in the City of Brotherly Love. He is a journalist, photojournalist and proud Philadelphian. Miller worked at the <em>Philadelphia Daily News</em> for more than 11 years, serving as a staff photographer, features writer, general assignment reporter and police beat writer.His words and images have appeared throughout the paper, in every section. Since leaving the paper in 2005, he has freelanced as a writer and photographer for numerous publications, on numerous subjects. The only common denominator in all his articles (and images) is that they are focused on the city and its citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Mulcahy</strong>, owner of Red Flag Media, Inc., grew up in Wilkes-Barre, PA. After finishing his English degree at King’s College in Wilkes-Barre, he went to work for the independent record store, Gallery of Sound. He became interested in the store’s music publication, and eventually bid to take over the business. Mulcahy’s passion for music and writing helped the publication mature to the point that he began creating publications for independent record stores around the country.</p>
<p>One of Alex’s first employees, Alex Mudrain, was a fellow music buff, particularly of extreme music. Mulcahy encouraged him to expand his writing on the genre into a book, which became <em>Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal &amp; Grindcore</em>. The success of <em>Choosing Death</em> led to the creation of <em>Decibel Magazine</em> in 2004, Red Flag Media’s first national newsstand publication. Since 2009, Mulcahy has delved into another of his passions with <em>GRID Magazine</em>, a free monthly publication devoted to sustainability issues and initiatives in the Greater Philadelphia area. In 2011, Red Flag Media relaunched the beloved independent music magazine, <em>MAGNET</em>.</p>

Join Patricia Anne Masters of George Mason University, Carol Muller of the University of Pennsylvania and Diane Turner of Temple’s Charles L.

She spent more than five years with the Mummers, observing their lives and rituals as she took part in their preparations and parades.

<p><strong>Carol Muller </strong>is a professor of music at the University of Pennsylvania who has published widely on South African music. At Penn, she has run academically based community service projects linking music and spirituality in West Philadelphia. Her classes have studied traditions of gospel and Islamic music in the neighborhoods surrounding Penn. Musical Echoes: South African Women Thinking in Jazz (Duke 2011) with Sathima Bea Benjamin and Focus: South African Music (Routledge 2008) are some of the books Muller has authored and edited.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Turner </strong>is a historian and the curator of the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection. Her publications include My Name is Oney Judge and Feeding the Soul: Black Music, Black Thought. She has produced exhibitions at the African American Museum in Philadelphia, where she served as a curator, and the Rosenbach Museum and Library, where Look Again: African-American History is American History was the first exhibit of African and African American items in the museum’s history.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Join WRTI’s Jim Cotter in Conversation with Larry Magid, one of the founders of Philly music-scene fixture, the Electric Factory and Electric Factory Concerts.</em> A pioneer in the concert industry and a fixture on the Philadelphia concert scene for more than forty years, Larry Magid opened the Electric Factory in February 1968 with a show featuring the Chamber Brothers, who declared, “My soul&#8217;s been psychedelicized!” He has produced more than 15,000 concerts, orchestrated such Philadelphia milestones as Live Aid in 1985 and Live 8 in 2005, won two Tony Awards, and produced Billy Crystal’s 700 Sundays—the largest grossing non-musical in Broadway history. At Paley Library, Magid will share the most memorable moments from his over four decades in the music business in conversation with WRTI’s Jim Cotter. After the program, he will sign copies My Soul&#8217;s Been Psychedelicized, a spectacular photographic history of the acts that have performed at the Factory and in Factory-produced concerts. The book includes concert posters, photographs, and promotional items featuring both rising stars and established performers, such as Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Bette Midler, Elvis Presley, Tina Turner, Pearl Jam and many, many more. Since 2002, Jim Cotter has been WRTI&#8217;s arts and culture reporter and then editor. And since 2003, he&#8217;s been the host and producer of Creatively Speaking! the much-acclaimed Saturday morning arts and culture program that has been the recipient of several awards and commendations including two Philadelphia A.I.R (Achievement In Radio) awards and an Excellence in Broadcasting award from the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters. <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img class="mt-image-left alignleft" style="margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px" alt="Facebook logo" src="https://sites.temple.edu/library/files/2012/05/Facebook-Logo.png" width="37" height="37" /></span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=139039769509883#!/event.php?eid=139039769509883">Register on facebook</a> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=139039769509883#!/pages/Temple-University-Libraries/6340283058">Like us too!</a> <strong>REVIEWS REVIEWS REVIEWS</strong> &#8220;Music buff and music historian alike will find a lot to be intrigued about with the coffee-table book dedicated to one of Philadelphia’s premier music venues&#8230;.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong> <em>Author Sara Marcus discusses researching and writing her extraordinary <span style="text-decoration: underline">Girls to the Front</span>, the first-ever published history of the seminal 1990s Riot Grrrl movement. She will address the culture, the music, and the art that have made an indelible impact on music and feminism today, the personalities that brought this movement to the forefront, and how the Riot Grrrl story lives on. The past few years have seen a resurgence of interest in Riot Grrrl, and a renewed appreciation for the music, art, and politics of this vital cultural movement.</em></p>
<p>Sara Marcus is a writer and musician living in Brooklyn, New York. Her prose and poetry have appeared in publications including <em>Artforum</em>, <em>Bookforum</em>, Slate, Salon, the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, <em>Death</em>, and EOAGH. She is a founding editor of New Herring Press. Riot Grrrl roared into the spotlight in 1991: an uncompromising movement of girls with no patience for sexism and no intention of keeping quiet.</p>
<p>Young women everywhere were realizing that the equality they’d been promised was still elusive. In response, thousands of riot grrrls published zines, founded local groups, and organized national conventions, while fiercely prophetic punk bands such as Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Huggy Bear, and Bikini Kill helped spread the word across the US and to Canada, Europe, and beyond. <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img class="mt-image-left alignleft" style="margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px" alt="Facebook logo" src="https://sites.temple.edu/library/files/2012/05/Facebook-Logo.png" width="37" height="37" /></span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=238656679497511#!/event.php?eid=238656679497511">Register on Facebook!</a> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=187860961272691#!/pages/Temple-University-Libraries/6340283058">Like us, too!</a></p>
<p><strong>REVIEWS, REVIEWS, REVIEWS</strong> Girls to the Front is the first meticulously researched book about Riot Grrrl… I think this book is pretty on. <em>Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill and LeTigre</em> A historical rockument of the revolutionary 90s counterculture Riot Grrrl movement. . . . A rousing inspiration for a new generation of empowered rebel girls to strap on guitars and stick it to The Man. <em>Vanity Fair</em> Feminism seems to change every five years. It&#8217;s hard to grasp the movement. But you don&#8217;t have to live a lifetime to get the idea and energy of it, and Sara Marcus&#8217;s book channels what it is to make it your own. Girls to the Front is not just a keeper of the flame but brings you to your own fire.</p>

How do you follow the music scene in the age of basement shows, myspace and internet memes? Where do you begin to gain access to bands, and what is the value of publishing print magazines in an information universe of blogs, tumblrs and youtube? The founders and editors of some of today’s most influential and interesting music journalism projects will answer these questions, and more, at Paley Library.

Alex Mulcahy has launched <em>Grid</em>, <em>Decibel</em> and <em>Cowbell</em> magazines. <em>Grid</em> has a Philly cult following, and reports on culture, sustainability and the environment. Mulchay’s <em>Decibel</em> is the nation’s only monthly metal magazine. <em>Cowbell </em>is his latest venture in music publishing. After the panel stay for the launch of <em>JUMP</em>’s November issue, a reception featuring local musicians including Violet Turning Violet.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>April 21, 5:30 PM, Paley Library Lecture Hall, 1210 Polett Walk Tasting Freedom: Octavius Catto and The Battle for Quality in Civil War America: A Conversation with Authors Daniel R. Biddle and Murray Dubin </strong>Octavius Valentine Catto was a second baseman on Philadelphia’s best black baseball team, a teacher, an activist who fought in the state capital and on the streets for equal rights, and an orator who shared the stage with Frederick Douglass. With his murder during an election day race riot in 1871, the nation lost a civil rights pioneer. In Tasting Freedom, Daniel Biddle (winner of the Pulitzer Prize) and Murray Dubin painstakingly chronicle the life of this charismatic black leader. <em>Tasting Freedom</em> presents the little-known stories of Catto and the men and women who struggled to change America. Join the authors for a discussion on researching, reconstructing and writing this important American story. <a href="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/authors/1839_qa.html">Q&amp;A with the authors</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abe4-9EXtgQ">Watch </a>the authors discuss their research. <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq_ed_board/Chat_Murray_Dubin_on_civil_rights_leaders_in_the_19th_Century_.html">Hear </a>Murray Dubin speak on Civil Rights leaders in the 19th century.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>April 14, 5:30 PM, Paley Library Lecture Hall, 1210 Polett Walk </strong></em><strong>Bury Me in My Jersey: A Conversation with Tom McAllister and Rey Didinger</strong><em><strong></strong></em><br />
Tom McAllister, a Temple faculty member, was born and raised in Philadelphia, where he spent Sundays in the infamous 700 level of Veterans Stadium, or sitting in front of the TV with his father in a nearby recliner, watching both the ugly and beautiful sides of Philadelphia football. As a rabid Eagles fan, McAllister experiences defeats and disappointments, but his biggest challenge is coping with the premature loss of his father to cancer. In Bury Me in My Jersey, McAllister explores the connection between his dedication to the Eagles and the death of his father. He will read from his book and join in conversation with one of Philadelphia’s most hallowed sports writers, Ray Didinger. They will discuss writing, writing about sports and, of course, the Eagles.</p>
<p><strong>Tom McAllister</strong> is a graduate of the Iowa Writers&#8217; Workshop, and La Salle University in Philadelphia. His work has appeared in several publications, including Barrelhouse, Black Warrior Review, and Storyglossia. A Lecturer in the English Department at Temple University, he lives with his wife and two dogs in New Jersey, a ten minute drive from Lincoln Financial Field, where the Eagles play their home games.</p>
<p><strong>Ray Didinger </strong>has won six Emmy Awards as a writer and producer at NFL Films. Before that, he was a reporter covering the National Football League for The Philadelphia Bulletin, and later The Philadelphia Daily News. In 1995 he was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame as the recipient of the Dick McCann Memorial Award for long and distinguished reporting of pro football. He is the author of One Last Read, and a weekly commentator and panelist on Comcast SportsNet&#8217;s Post Game Live show during the football season.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>March 15, 4:00 PM, Paley Library Lecture Hall, 1210 Polett Walk </strong><br />
<strong>One Book, One Philadelphia Program: Wissahickon Scenes</strong><br />
Classical composer and Temple professor Maurice Wright composed <em>Wissahickon Scenes</em> for the Philadelphia Classical Symphony. Based on rare recordings of Lenape songs supplied from the archives of the American Philosophical Society, this work was commissioned as an aural expression of Native American history. In the work, three movements depict three periods in Lenape history — Lenape Dances, for the 18th Century when the Lenape flourished; Trail of Tears, for the exodus of the Lenape; and The Invisible People, suggesting the Lenape situation today. Join Temple University Libraries and the One Book, One Philadelphia program as Wright discusses the process of composing a classical work based on archival records and how he approached Native American history.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>March 14, 4PM Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong> This year’s One Book, One Philadelphia selection, Sherman Alexie’s War Dances, is a collection of short stories and poems that examine the intricate facets of human relationships. Alexie weaves issues of personal identity throughout this book, many of them focusing on his experiences as a Native American in the Northwest. The Senator’s Son, one of the most moving tales in the book, however, touches on sexual identity. Through the lens of this story, panelists Mary Catherine Roper of the ACLU, Allison Buehler of the Mazzoni Center, and Gloria Casarez of City Hall’s LGBT Affairs Office discuss issues facing the queer community today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>February 24, 5:00 PM Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong><br />
Producer Zilan Munas and director Warren Bass discuss their documentary about the courageous African American soldiers who aided the Union to victory. This movie tells the story of the soldiers at Camp William Penn, the first and largest training camp for African American soldiers during the Civil War. Please join us for a screening, followed by a discussion of the research and process involved in creating this historical documentary.</p>
<p><em><strong>More about today’s film:</strong></em> <em>BLACK SOLDIERS IN BLUE</em> is the story of the recruitment of black volunteers in the American Civil War and their training at Camp William Penn. The film documents their hardships, their heroism and their contribution to the outcome of the war. Over 178,000 African Americans served in the Northern Army during the Civil War. 11,000 were trained at Camp William Penn, the first and largest federal training camp for black soldiers. The campgrounds were located just outside Philadelphia next to the estate of Quaker abolitionist Lucretia Mott, an important stop on the underground railroad. “United States Colored Troops” (USCT) fought in many important battles including the capture of the Confederate capital of Richmond and the surrender of Robert E. Lee. In the final years of the War, the USCT were approximately a tenth of the Union Army. They suffered 68,178 losses.</p>
<p><strong>About the filmmaker:</strong> Warren Bass (writer, director, editor, camera) is an independent filmmaker and Professor of Film &amp; Media Arts at Temple. He was trained at the Yale School of Drama in directing and at Columbia University in film as their School of the Arts Scholar. He has taught at Yale, NYU, the State University of California, and the American Film Institute and has directed theater at Lincoln Center, off-Broadway and in regional professional theater. His work has received over 120 regional, national and international awards including both the 2003 and 2005 Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowships in Film.</p>

All of these talented, important women were Delta Sigma Thetas. The Blockson Collection’s fall exhibition celebrates the Epsilon Delta Chapter of Philadelphia, started at Temple fifty years ago. Hundreds of women&#8211;some are household names and some you do not yet know&#8211;have been part of this important organization of African American women. Look at their history, and take a trip into Philadelphia’s past, with this exhibition. <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img class="mt-image-left alignleft" style="margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 0px" src="https://sites.temple.edu/library/files/2012/05/Aretha-FranklinSMALL.jpg" alt="Aretha FranklinSMALL.jpg" width="314" height="233" /></span> Legendary Aretha Franklin, image from the Blockson Collection <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img class="mt-image-left" style="margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 0px" src="https://sites.temple.edu/library/files/2012/05/Lena-HorneSMALL.jpg" alt="Lena HorneSMALL.jpg" width="235" height="293" /></span> Singer, actress, activist Lean Horne, image from the Blockson Collection</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>December 1, 3:30 PM In Conversation with Andrew Lam <em>East Eats West: The unexpected Consequences of Asian Immigration to America</em> Paley Library Lecture Hall, 1210 Polett Walk, Ground Floor</strong> From cuisine and martial arts to sex and self-esteem, East Eats West shines new light on the bridges and crossroads where two hemispheres meld into one worldwide &#8220;immigrant nation.&#8221; In this new nation, with its amalgamation of divergent ideas, tastes, and styles, today&#8217;s bold fusion becomes tomorrow&#8217;s classic. But while the space between East and West continues to shrink in this age of globalization, some cultural gaps remain. Andrew Lam, the award-winning author of Perfume Dreams, continues to explore the Vietnamese diaspora, this time concentrating not only on how the East and West have changed but how they are changing each other. And he&#8217;ll talk about what it is like to thrive in the West with one foot still in the East.&#8221; Andrew is a writer and an editor with the Pacific News Service, a short story writer, and, has been, for 8 years, a commentator on National Public Radio’s “All Things Considered.” He co-founded New America Media, an association of over 2000 ethnic media organizations in America. His essays have appeared in dozens of newspapers across the country, including the New York Times, The LA Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Baltimore Sun, The Atlanta Journal, and the Chicago Tribune. His short stories are also anthologized widely and taught in many Universities and colleges. This program is part of the Language and Linguistics Speaker Series organized by the Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages Program. Support also provided by CIBER in the Fox School of Business and Management, GenEd, Vietnamese Studies, Department of English and the Faculty Senate Lectures and Forums Committee.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>@ Paley Library Lecture Hall, Ground Floor, 1210 Polett Walk <em>Record, Preserve, Document, Shape: Talking About the Public Humanities A Conversation with Curator and Scholar Steven Lubar of the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage at Brown University</em> How do museums, libraries, archives, universities and other public institutions shape the recording and presentation of artistic and cultural heritage? How does that inform our understanding of the past, present, and future? How do we disseminate humanistic research originating within the ivory tower to the world-at-large? What is the future of cultural programming and publicly funded arts and humanities initiatives? Join a conversation on the state of public culture with Seth Bruggeman of Temple’s Center for Public History and Steven Lubar of Brown University’s John Nicholas Brown Center for the Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage. Lubar is one of the country’s foremost public historians, and leads a graduate program and think tank at Brown University that explores these questions, and more. Prior to Brown, Lubar was a curator at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. There, he went on to chair the Division of the History of Technology and oversee several major permanent exhibitions, including the groundbreaking America on the Move, which examines the history of public transportation in the United States. In addition to his work at the Smithsonian, Lubar has taught at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Maryland and the University of Pennsylvania. <em>This program is co-sponsored by the Center for Public History at Temple, Village of Arts and Humanities, the Wagner Free Institute of Science, the North Philadelphia Arts and Culture Alliance, and the Center for Public History at Temple.</em> <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img class="mt-image-left alignleft" style="margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 0px" src="https://sites.temple.edu/library/files/2012/05/FOTM4SMALL.jpg" alt="FOTM4SMALL.JPG" /></span> <em>Food on the Move</em> exhibition curated by John Nicholas Brown Center students, explores the culture around dining out, fast food, and its impact on culture and lifestyle. <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img class="mt-image-left alignleft" style="margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 0px" src="https://sites.temple.edu/library/files/2012/05/Lots-in-Limbo2SMALL.jpg" alt="Lots in Limbo2SMALL.jpg" width="314" height="235" /></span> John Nicholas Brown Center <em>Lots in Limbo</em> project, created public art in under-utilized space in Providence, RI. <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img class="mt-image-left alignleft" style="margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 0px" src="https://sites.temple.edu/library/files/2012/05/StevenLubarHeadshot.jpg" alt="StevenLubarHeadshot.jpg" width="160" height="116" /></span> Steven Lubar, photo by Mike Cohea/Brown University</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>National GIS Day Celebration November 17th, 2010, 3:00 &#8211; 5:00PM Paley Library Lecture Hall  Agenda: 3:00 &#8211; 4:00 PM: Presentations              4:00 &#8211; 5:00 PM: Reception  On Wednesday, November 17th, 2010, join Temple University Libraries in celebrating it&#8217;s 2nd Annual National GIS Day. The two hour event will begin at 3:00 PM with presentations by invited speakers, followed with a reception.  Our first speaker, Dr. Amy Hillier, is an Assistant Professor in City and Regional Planning at PennDesign, the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s School of Design, where she teaches classes on the application of GIS in city planning, urban studies, public health, and social work. She is also is one of the faculty co-directors at the Cartographic Modeling Laboratory (CML), where she works with other faculty to integrate GIS into projects dealing with obesity, gun violence, pre-term birth, and injuries to children. One of her current projects is recreating the old 7th ward of Philadelphia studied by W.E.B. Du Bois in 1896 for his classic book, The Philadelphia Negro, using GIS, archival records, and 1900 census data to create an online mapping system and curriculum materials for high school and college students.   Our 2nd speaker, Professor Jim Querry, is an Adjunct Professor at Philadelphia University, where he teaches introductory and advanced undergraduate GIS courses in the Department of Architecture. He is also the GIS Director at City of Philadelphia, where he directs a citywide, cross-departmental collaboration in enterprise GIS to enable City departments and related agencies to increase their productivity, effectiveness and delivery of services to city residents. In 2008, on behalf of the City of Philadelphia, he received the prestigious Presidents&#8217; Award at the 2008 ESRI International User Conference, given to honor the city for its leadership and innovation in developing enterprise geographic information system (GIS) deployments that improve numerous government functions and city services.   The presentations will be followed by a reception with light fare and opportunities to meet the speakers and other guests.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>@ Paley Library Lecture Hall, Ground Floor, 1210 Polett Walk <em>n+1</em> editors Marco Roth and Keith Gessen will discuss what it takes to start a print literary journal, survive the battle of ideas with other magazines (and the internet), and even get some writing done on the side. <em>n +1</em> is a twice-yearly print journal of politics, literature, and culture. Jonathan Franzen has said of the publication, “Just when you’re thinking you’re intellectually alone in the world, something like n+1 falls into your hands,” and A.O. Scott raved in the New York Times magazine that the periodical offers “[p]ointed, closely argued and often brilliantly original critiques of contemporary life and letters.” Gessen is an essayist, novelist, and translator from Russian. His first novel, <em>All the Sad Young Literary Men,</em> was published in 2008, and he has written for the <em>New Yorker</em>, the <em>London Review of Books</em>, and other print and web-based periodicals. Roth lives here in Philadelphia and is a 2009 Pew Fellow in the Arts. His essays have appeared in <em>Dissent and the Nation</em>; his memoir, <em>Reverse Transcription</em>, will be published by Farrar Straus and Giroux in 2011. <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img class="mt-image-left alignleft" style="margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 0px" src="https://sites.temple.edu/library/files/2012/05/Avant_Garde.png" alt="Avant_Garde.png" width="300" height="260" /></span> <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img class="mt-image-left" style="margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 0px" src="https://sites.temple.edu/library/files/2012/05/n19.png" alt="n+19.png" /></span></p>

Join us as Gould reads from her new book, <em>And the Heart Says Whatever</em>, then discusses with Blau DuPlessis her opinions on online journalism, feminism, the media, publishing, food, cats and dogs, and answers audience questions. Gould is a former editor of the groundbreaking blog and online magazine, Gawker.com. She then became a household name with the publication of Exposed in the <em>New York Times </em>magazine. This feature-length article recounted her experiences at Gawker, and sparked controversy and generated abundant commentary on the Times website. Gould now shares her thoughts on eclectic topics from feminism to social media at <em>Emily Magazine</em>, a popular blog, and recently published her first full-length memoir, <em>And the Heart Says Whatever</em> (Free Press, 2010). She is also the host of the web-program<em> Cooking the Books</em>, a literature and foodie talk show, and continues to write for periodicals both in print and online, such as Slate.com and the <em>New York Times</em>. Blau DuPlessis is a writer, poet, critic and feminist scholar. She received her PhD from Columbia University in 1970 and has been teaching and writing ever since. She received the 2002 Pew Fellowship in the Arts and a 2008-2009 Fellowship at the National Humanities Center and published over 15 books of original poems, scholarship and criticism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>October 13, Paley Library Lecture Hall, 4:00 PM</strong> <em>Dire Predictions: Understanding Global Warming</em> Michael Mann, one of the nation’s leading climatologists, is the director of the Earth System Science Center and a professor at the Pennsylvania State University. He received his doctorate in Geology and Geophysics from Yale University in 1998. Mann met controversy in 2009 when documents and emails, written by him and other leading climatologists, were made public after the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit’s server was hacked. Skeptics seized on these communications, claiming they brought into question the legitimacy of global warming. The Pennsylvania State University cleared Mann of any wrongdoing, and independent reviews by FactCheck and the Associated Press said that critics misrepresented emails to support unfounded claims of scientific misconduct. “Climategate,” however, remains a potent example of the politicization of science. Temple University Libraries and the Center for the Humanities at Temple welcome Dr. Mann, as he discusses the discourse around science in today’s political climate. He will also focus on his book, Dire Predictions: Understanding Global Warming, and the science of climate change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em> Temple Gallery, Tyler School of Art and Temple University Libraries Present:</em> <strong>YEVGENIY FIKS: POST-SOVIET WITHOUT SHORES</strong> <strong>TEXT/POLITICS/ART—<em>Lenin for Your Library?, Ayn Rand in Illustrations, and Communist Tour of MoMA</em></strong> <em>Introduction by Temple Gallery guest curator Stamatina Gregory</em> Russian-born Yevgeniy Fiks discusses the influence of text and politics on his art, which faces head-on the Post-Soviet dialog in the West. Fiks draws influence for many of his politically poignant works from book. Projects such as <em>Lenin for Your Library?</em> in which the artist sent V.I. Lenin’s I<em>mperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism</em> to 100 corporate libraries, documenting and archiving the responses to his mailing, demonstrate this. A later project, Ayn Rand in Illustrations, attempts to add a visual component to three of the author’s major books: <em>We the Living</em>, <em>The Fountainhead</em>, and <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>. Join the Libraries and Temple Gallery, Tyler School of Art as this intriguing artist shares the process and product of his work. <strong>DISCUSSION follows at Temple Gallery, 12th and Norris Streets, 6:30 PM</strong> Following his lecture, Yevgeniy Fiks will participate in a public discussion about his work and its relationship to art and politics, Cold-War legacy, and more. Students from Topics in Contemporary Art, taught by Tyler’s Philip Glahn, will lead the discussion. This lecture is presented in conjunction with the exhibition <em>Yevgeniy Fiks: Communist Conspiracy in Art Threatens American Museums</em>, which runs from September 8-November 6 at Temple Gallery. <em>Yevgeniy Fiks: Post-Soviet Without Shores</em> is supported in part by the Friends of Temple Gallery, Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, and Temple University Libraries. <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img class="mt-image-left alignleft" style="margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 0px" src="https://sites.temple.edu/library/files/2012/05/templegallery_fiks_donderoinstallationSMALL.jpg" alt="templegallery_fiks_donderoinstallationSMALL.jpg" width="160" height="86" /></span> Installation view of Tour of MoMA with Congressman Dondero, 2010 in the exhibition Yevgeniy Fiks: Communist Conspiracy in Art Threatens American Museums at Temple Gallery at Tyler School of Art, Temple University, September 8 &#8211; November 6, 2010.

After the performance, scholars Laura Levitt, Roland Williams, and Susan Klepp, as well as writer and performer Roberta Sloan, will discuss the role that scholars and historical methods played in the creation of this artistic work.</p>

The event will be preceded by a tour of the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at 4:00 p.m. The collection is located at 1330 W.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Temple University Libraries, the Free Library of Philadelphia and the Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy Present: Gender, the Middle East, and Western Reactions, A Conversation with Joan Scott, Todd Shepard and Kelly Shannon, moderated by Laura Levitt </strong> <em>March 3, 2:30 p.m, Paley Library Lecture Hall (Ground Floor, 1210 Polett Walk)</em>. Joan Scott of the Institute for Advance Study, Todd Shepard of Johns Hopkins, and Kelly Shannon, doctoral candidate in history and a Center for the Humanities at Temple graduate fellow, in conversation with Temple’s Laura Levitt on issues of gender in the Middle East, and how Western nations have responded. Just as <em>Persepolis</em> has become a sensational hit with Western audiences, these scholars will demonstrate how Westerners have viewed Muslim gender relations and taken action to alleviate the perceived oppression of women in Muslim communities, from banning the headscarf in French schools to integrating concerns for women&#8217;s rights into U.S. foreign policy. Program presented as part of the 2010 ONE BOOK, ONE PHILADELPHIA program featuring Marjane Satrapi’s <em>The Complete Persepolis</em>. Please join us on March 3 for this exciting conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Joan W. Scott</strong> is Harold F. Linder Professor of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study. Scott studies French history and the history of women and gender. Her most recent book is The Politics of the Veil, which critically analyzes the debates in France about the banning of Islamic headscarves in state schools.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Shepard </strong>teaches in the History department at Johns Hopkins University. He explores 20th-century France and the French Empire, with a focus on how imperialism intersects with histories of national identity, state institutions, race, and sexuality; his studies and teaching have concentrated on modern European history (particularly France), modern colonialism, and the history of sexuality.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Shannon</strong> (A.B., Vassar; M.A., University of Connecticut) is a Ph.D. Candidate in History at Temple University. Her dissertation, &#8220;Veiled Intentions: Islam, Global Feminism, and U.S. Foreign Policy Since the Late 1970s&#8221; interrogates the U.S. discourse about the perceived oppression of Muslim women since the Iranian Revolution and examines how that discourse came to influence the formulation of U.S. foreign policy toward the Muslim world in recent decades. Kelly is currently the CHAT Graduate Teaching Fellow for the Center for the Humanities at Temple, and she has received various fellowships and awards from the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, the Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy, and Temple University.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Temple Book Club Discussion on Persepolis February 18, 1:00 p.m. Paley Library Lecture Hall </strong>  Temple University Libraries once again participate in <em>One Book, One Philadelphia</em> by hosting a book club discussion of this year’s reading selection, <em>The Complete Persepolis</em>.  Originally published in France in two volumes, this graphic novel is poignant, humorous and heartbreaking, a memoir of growing up in Iran during a time of revolution and repression. It presents readers with a unique glimpse into Iran’s political repression, the inner-workings of a family, and one woman’s experience as an outsider both at home and abroad.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Wednesday, November 18 11:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m., Paley Library Lecture Hall  <strong> Temple University Libraries  Celebrate National GIS Day! </strong></em>   On Wednesday, November 18th, 2009,  join Temple University Libraries in celebrating National GIS Day. The two hour event will begin at 11:00 AM with presentations by invited speakers, followed with a reception.   Matthew Harris will make the first presentation. A Master’s graduate from Temple’s Anthropology Department, Harris will speak on the topic of applying GIS skills in the Social Sciences. He will draw on his experiences as an archeologist, GIS analyst, and GIS manager to discuss the importance of finding a niche and creatively using GIS in a chosen field of study. Using examples from current and past projects, he will illustrate ways that GIS is applied to the field of Cultural Resources and more broadly to a number of GIS applications.      The second presentation will be given by Robert Cheetham, founder and CEO of Avencia Inc., a software design and development firm for geospatial analysis tools and services, with particular expertise in natural resource planning, economic development, crime analysis, real estate property analysis, and cultural resources.  He also serves on the advisory board of the Penn State Master’s in GIS program, and has served as the Senior GIS Developer for the City of Philadelphia and as Crime Analyst for the Philadelphia Police Department. In his presentation, Cheetham will highlight recent GIS initiatives at Avencia, including the PhillyHistory project as well as describe how the Avencia staff integrate GIS training.   The presentations will be followed by a reception with light fare and opportunities to meet the speakers and other guests.   Please forward this announcement to students and others who are interested in GIS.  I look forward to seeing everyone in the Philadelphia GIS community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Panel Discussion on the Work of Wolgin Prize Finalist Michael Rakowitz October 15, 5:30 p.m., Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong>  At this event, scholars and critics will examine Michael Rakowitz’s art as social commentary that explores problematic urban situations. The Invisible Enemy Should Not Exist, the focus of Rakowtiz’s WolginPrize exhibition, discusses objects stolen from the National Museum of Iraq in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of April 2003. This piece attempts to make “war culture” more visible in America in the hopes that outrage over the stolen objects translates to outrage towards the loss of life. Participants include Temple University’s Susan Feagin, Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Temple University and Editor of The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism; Philip Glahn, Assistant Professor in the Department of Painting, Drawing and Sculpture, Tyler School of Art; Dustin Kidd, Assistant Professor, Sociology; and Srdjan Jovanović Weiss, Assistant Professor in the Department of Architecture at Tyler School of Art.  <em>This event is part of a series of collaborative public programs presented in conjunction with the Tyler School of Art’s Jack Wolgin International Competition in the Fine Arts</em>  <strong>About Wolgin Prize Finalist Michael Rakowitz</strong> Based in Chicago and New York, Michael Rakowitz&#8217;s (b. 1973, New York) art practice is characterized by its exploration of and symbolic interventions with problematic urban situations, as well as endeavors to make visible other urgent moments of silence, invisibility, and marginality. In 1998, he initiated paraSITE, an ongoing project in which the artist custom builds inflatable shelters for homeless people that attach to the exterior outtake vents of a building&#8217;s heating, ventilation, or air conditioning system. Other recent projects include the public work, Return, presented by Creative Time in New York, and The invisible enemy should not exist. His work has been exhibited in venues worldwide including P.S. 1, Long Island City, NY; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; MASSMoCA, North Adams, MA; Castello di Rivoli, Turin; and biennials and triennials including the 16th Biennale of Sydney; the 10th Istanbul Biennial; Sharjah Biennial 8; the Tirana Biennale; the National Design Triennial at the Cooper Hewitt; and Transmediale 05. He also has been the recipient of a number of prestigious international artist grants and fellowships, and has had numerous solo exhibitions at galleries and art spaces through the U.S. and Europe, including a forthcoming show at the Tate Modern in London.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Panel Discussion on the Works of Wolgin Prize Finalist Ryan Trecartin October 7, 5:30 pm, Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong>  Ryan Trecartin’s work advances understandings of post‐millennial technology, narrative and identity. Discussed from a variety of perspectives, panelists will examine issues of social media and networks; gender and aesthetic themes in video art; and more. Participants include Temple University’sGerard Brown, Chair of Foundations, Tyler School of Art (moderator); Scott Gratson, Director of the Communications Program and SCT Undergraduate Studies; Aaron Smuts, Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy; Elisabeth Subrin, Assistant Professor in the Department of Film and Media Arts; and Andrew Suggs, Executive Director of Vox Populi Gallery, Philadelphia.  <em>This event is part of a series of collaborative public programs presented in conjunction with the Tyler School of Art’s Jack Wolgin International Competition in the Fine Arts</em>  <strong>About Finalist Ryan Trecartin</strong>  Ryan Trecartin (b. 1981, Webster, TX) lives and works in Philadelphia, PA, where he structures his art practice in varying collaborative ways. Trecartin has established a singular video practice that, in both form and in function, advances understandings of post-millennial technology, narrative and identity, and also propels these matters as expressive mediums. His work depicts worlds where consumer culture is amplified and absorbed to absurd or nihilistic proportions where characters circuitously strive to find agency and meaning in their lives. The combination of assaultive, nearly impenetrable avant-garde logics and equally outlandish, virtuoso uses of color, form, drama and montage produces a sublime, stream-of-consciousness effect that feels bewilderingly true to life. In addition to his work in video, Trecartin also has a collaborative sculpture practice with artist Lizzie Fitch. Trecartin&#8217;s work has been included in several major exhibitions and institutions worldwide, including the 2006 Whitney Biennial, New York; the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; the Saatchi Gallery, London; and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Film Series Curated by Wolgin Prize Finalist Sanford Biggers</strong> <strong><em>Strange Fruit,</em> Dir. Joel Katz, 2002, 57 min. September 30, 7:00 p.m., Paley Library Lecture Hall Introduction by Dr. Diane D. Turner, Curator of the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection</strong> Director Joel Katz explores the history of the popular song &#8220;Strange Fruit,&#8221; written by Abel Meeropol and famously performed by Billie Holiday, through interviews with musicians, historians, genealogists and more. Katz fashions a fascinating discovery of the lost story behind this heartbreaking American classic. <em>This event is part of a series of collaborative public programs presented in conjunction with the Tyler School of Art’s Jack Wolgin International Competition in the Fine Arts</em> <strong>About Wolgin Prize Finalist Sanford Biggers</strong> Sanford Biggers (b. 1970, Los Angeles) is a native of Los Angeles, California, and current New York resident, who uses the study of ethnological objects, popular icons, and the Dadaist tradition to explore cultural and creative syncretism, art history, and politics. An accomplished musician, Biggers often incorporates performative elements into his sculptures and installations, resulting in multilayered works that act as anecdotal vignettes, at once full of wit and clear formal intent. Biggers has won several awards and has participated in a number of prestigious national and international artist residencies and fellowships. Sanford Biggers&#8217; installations, videos, and performances have appeared in institutions in China, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Poland and Russia as well as several notable exhibitions such as the Prospect.1/New Orleans biennial, Illuminations at the Tate Modern, Performa 07, the Whitney Biennial and Freestyle at the Studio Museum in Harlem. He is currently preparing for solo shows at the Contemporary Arts Forum in Santa Barbara and the Brooklyn Museum and a permanent commission in New York City through the New York Percent for Art. <strong>About the Competition</strong> Created in 2009 by the real estate developer, banker and philanthropist Jack Wolgin of Philadelphia, the Jack Wolgin International Competition in the Fine Arts was established at the Temple University Tyler School of Art to recognize an emerging artist with a significant studio practice who critically and creatively engages with existing histories and images, and whose work transcends traditional boundaries. With a cash prize of $150,000, the Jack Wolgin International Competition in the Fine Arts grants the world’s largest juried visual art prize awarded to an individual. Inspired by the diversity of Temple University and its unique connection to the thriving art communities of Philadelphia, Mr. Wolgin chose the Tyler School to host and administrate the Competition. By bringing the work of innovative and talented artists to the Tyler School, the Competition seeks to open a dialogue among students, the diverse communities of Philadelphia, and the greater art world. The exchange of ideas and art inspired by the Jack Wolgin International Competition in the Fine Arts also perpetuates the spirit of Philadelphia, a cultural hub since our nation’s founding, rich in both historic and contemporary art.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Urban Archives recently opened the summer exhibition <em>Art in the Archives. </em> The Greater Philadelphia Region has long been a center for the arts. From the collections at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, to the estimable holdings of modern work by the Barnes Collection, to Calder sculptures lining the parkway, to the stunning array of creative works being produced in our universities, galleries, and arts organizations, Philadelphia has a deep, broad connection to artistic production. The <em>Art in the Archives</em> exhibition, culled from the over 5 million images in the Urban Archives’ collections, documents the region’s strong connection to creative arts in all forms. These images explore art from the point of view of both the producer and the consumer. They display a wide variety of mediums. And, we hope they show the impact that art has had on our region, and the impact Philadelphia has had on the arts. Come see this exhibition, on display through the summer on Paley&#8217;s ground floor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Public History and the Infinite Archive April 22, 3:30 p.m., Paley Library, Lecture Hall</strong> Please join us in welcoming renowned public historian William Turkel. Dr. Turkel, who received his PhD at MIT and teaches at the University of Western Ontario, examines how the web has changed public history. It has the potential to become an infinite archive, the largest and most radically unfamiliar archive ever created. Turkel asks: how can historians and other humanists adopt new methodologies to make the best use of it for research, teaching and public dialogue? Join us to discuss this question facing today’s scholars. This event has been co-sponsored by the American Studies and History Departments, the Center for the Humanities at Temple and the American Philosophical Society.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Secret Cinema Films from the Urban Archives: Secrets from Philadelphia’s Past April 16,Paley Library, Lecture Hall Two original 90-minutes programs starting at 4:00 and 6:00 pm</strong> We’ve unearthed great tidbits of Philadelphia history from the Urban Archives’ film collections to be shown on screen and to the public for one day only by the Secret Cinema. This program is presented by film curator and collector Jay Schwartz, who has been providing audiences across Philadelphia with glimpses of rare treasures on 16mm film for over 15 years. He has curated programs for Eastern State Penitentiary, the American Philosophical Society, the Franklin Institute and Moore College of Art. Please join us for a special presentation at Temple University Libraries. Highlights include: SSIGNMENT: 1747 RANDOLPH STREET (1966) &#8211; A hard-hitting documentary from an ongoing series produced by WFIL-TV, this episode focuses on North Philadelphia&#8217;s Ludlow neighborhood &#8212; then awash with gangs, graffiti, abandoned homes, and violent crime. While many of these problems may now seem eternal, this close-up view of urban decay not yet taken for granted remains powerful and shocking. THE ELECTRIC FACTORY, NEWS FOOTAGE (1968?) &#8211; This reel of silent, outtake footage from a news report provides an invaluable look inside Philadelphia&#8217;s legendary psychedelic rock ballroom, then located in a former tire warehouse at 22nd &amp; Arch Streets. On display are lightshows, see-saws and sliding boards, clothing and face paint vendors, and coffin-like &#8220;body racks&#8221; for patrons in need of relaxation &#8212; the one detail of the old club that was faithfully recreated in the much larger concert venue of the same name that opened in the 1990s. The original Electric Factory, which hosted concerts by Jimi Hendrix, The Mothers of Invention, The Who, and many other legends, closed forever in 1970. CONNIE MACK STADIUM CLOSING, NEWS FOOTAGE (1970) &#8211; Another reel of outtake footage, showing the final game, fans removing seats, the man who stole home plate, and the final fan-made wreckage of the once proud baseball stadium in the calm of the following day. THE SPIRIT OF PHILADELPHIA: THE UNENDING RENAISSANCE (1966) &#8211; &#8220;By the end of the second World War, Philadelphia was a sick city.&#8221; This documentary takes a hopeful look towards a better future, with looks at the redevelopment of Society Hill, Market East and Penn&#8217;s Landing, archival scenes of the building of the Ben Franklin Parkway, and interviews with visionary city planner Ed Bacon. BROAD STREET STATION CLOSING NEWS FOOTAGE (1952) &#8211; A nostalgic and sad view of the last train to leave Frank Furness&#8217; grand railroad station, with music played on board by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Plus much. much more. <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img class="mt-image-left" style="margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;margin-left: 0px" src="https://sites.temple.edu/library/files/2012/05/SecretCinema.jpg" alt="SecretCinema.jpg" /></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Thursday, June 19 1:00-4:00 p.m. First Floor, Sullivan Hall</strong> On Thursday, June 19, the Blockson Collection will hold an open house to celebrate Juneteenth and open the collection to the Temple community and general public. Juneteenth is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States. Celebrated on June 19, it marks the announcement of the ending of slavery in Texas on that day in 1865. From its Galveston, Texas origin, the observance of this date as African American Emancipation Day has spread across the United States and beyond. This event provides an unprecedented opportunity to meet a man who made history, as Bernard Fernandez of the Negro Leagues will be the guest of honor. The event will also include: An opportunity to meet collection founder Charles L. Blockson and artist Francine Still Hicks at a book signing; Updates on the collection’s newest acquisitions from curator Dr. Diane Turner; A chance to tour the collection and see the historical materials in the region’s premier collection documenting African American history and culture. We hope to see you there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>April 17 1:00 pm Paley Library Lecture Hall</strong>  The Temple Book Club presents a discussion with author and historian Peter Cole.  Cole will speak on his book <em>Wobblies on the Waterfront: Interracial Unionism in Progressive Era Philadelphia </em>(University of Illinois Press, 2007).  Dr. Cole is a professor of history at Western Illinois University.  His research focuses on the intersections of class, ethnicity, and race in U.S. History.  Dr. Cole was born and raised in South Florida. He received his B.A. from Columbia University and his Ph.D. from Georgetown University. He has taught at Georgetown, Washington College, Western Maryland College, and most recently for two years at Boise State University.  About the Book: For almost a decade during the 1910s and 1920s, the Philadelphia waterfront was home to the most durable interracial, multiethnic union seen in the United States prior to the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) era. In a period when most unions, like many institutions, excluded blacks or segregated them, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was ideologically committed to racial equality. More than any other IWW affiliate, however, Local 8 worked to become a progressive, interracial union. For much of its time, the union majority was black, always with a cadre of black leaders, which included Ben Fletcher. Local 8 also claimed immigrants from Eastern Europe, as well as many Irish Americans, who had a notorious reputation for racism.   In <em>Wobblies on the Waterfront</em>, Peter Cole outlines the factors that were instrumental in Local 8&#8217;s success, both ideological (the IWW&#8217;s commitment to working-class solidarity) and pragmatic (racial divisions helped solidify employer dominance). He also shows how race was central not only to the rise but also to the decline of Local 8, as increasing racial tensions were manipulated by employers and federal agents bent on the union&#8217;s destruction.   Critics Say: &#8220;By demonstrating how interracial solidarity prevailed on the Philadelphia waterfront for the better part of a momentous and critically important decade, Peter Cole kindles the flames of the &#8216;class-race&#8217; debate. As he also demonstrates, Local 8&#8217;s achievements in this regard were all the more remarkable because the larger context&#8211;in Philadelphia and in the nation&#8211;was one of racial polarization and virulent white racism.&#8221;&#8211;Bruce Nelson, author of <em>Divided We Stand: American Workers and the Struggle for Black Equality</em>  &#8220;Wobblies on the Waterfront offers a fascinating and engaging look at the Philadelphia longshoremen in Local 8 of the IWW. Offering a fresh perspective on an important organization that charted its own, independent course in the 1910s and &#8217;20s, this study considerably adds to our knowledge of waterfront unionism, Philadelphia labor, the IWW, and race and labor. Local 8 deserves the in-depth treatment that Peter Cole gives it, for it stood out as a rather unique example of militant, interracial unionism in an age in which exclusion or segregation was the rule in the labor movement.&#8221;&#8211;Eric Arnesen, editor of <em>The Black Worker: Race, Labor, and Civil Rights since Emancipation</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March 26 4:30 pm Paley Library Lecture Hall Please join Temple University Libraries and the Temple University Press in welcoming author, entrepreneur and restaurateur Ellen Yin. The press recently published Yin’s Forklore: Recipes and Tales from an American Bistro, which coincided with the 10th Anniversary of her legendary Philadelphia restaurant, Fork. Yin will speak on her book, her accomplishments, and her restaurant, and then engage in conversation with guests. This event will also feature trivia, door prizes, and a reception. Yin’s book will also be for sale. Fork Restaurant is an acclaimed New American Bistro in Old City, Philadelphia.

Theorists such as Frederich Nietzsche and Michel Foucault influence Asad&#8217;s writings.  Those writings examine the fine lines which exist between concepts of good and evil, freedom and terror, pleasure and pain, control and power, justice and injustice.  Asad challenges his readers to think beyond the world of binaries and to examine the interconnections that shape the living world.  Asad received his Ph.D. from Oxford University and currently is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center.   This event is co-sponsored by the General Education Program, the Center for Humanities at Temple University (CHAT) and Temple University Libraries.</p>

McDowell <em>Philadelphia Evening Bulletin </em>Collection. The exhibit will include images of the anti-Vietnam War movement in the city and 1970 Black Panther Convention at Temple, as well as cover other important equal rights movements and political organizations. Come to Paley Library to see the historical record of this fascinating time in American history and culture as documented by images from the Urban Archives.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Thursday, October 25, 1:00pm Paley Library Lecture Hall Thom Nickels Philadelphia Architecture</strong>  On Thursday, October 25, Temple University Libraries welcomes Thom Nickels to the Temple Book Club.  Nickels will discuss his book <em>Philadelphia Architecture </em>(Arcadia, 2005), which celebrates the richness and diversity of our city’s built environment.      Nickels has a long history of architectural journalism, and in 2005 won the American Institute of Architects’ Lewis Mumford Award for Architectural Journalism.  He is the <em>The Bulletin’s </em>architecture critic, and writes a weekly column on the subject for <em>Philadelphia Metro</em>.  His knowledge of architecture goes back even further; he was raised in a family of architects and remembers leafing through his father’s trade magazines at a young age.  Nickels knew he would one day write on this topic; a meeting with famed Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius solidified this notion.  An accomplished writer, Nickels is also a poet, journalist and author of 7 books beyond <em>Philadelphia Architecture</em>: <em>The Cliffs of Aries </em>(Aegina Press, 1988), <em>Two Novellas: Walking Water &amp; After All This</em> (Banned Books, 1989), <em>The Boy on the Bicycle </em>(Starbooks Press, 2003), <em>Images of America: Manayunk </em>(Arcadia Publishing, 2001), <em>Images of America: Gay and Lesbian Philadelphia </em>(Arcadia Publishing, 2001) <em>Tropic of Libra </em>(Starbooks Press, 2002) and <em>Out in History </em>(Starbooks Press, 2005).  He is a Contributing Editor for <em>Philadelphia’s Weekly Press </em>and writes a social commentary column for STAR Publications.  Nickels writes extensively on travel and the arts, and co-founded the Arts Defense League.  He is also a regular contributor to the <em>Gay and Lesbian Review </em>and <em>Lambda Book Report</em>.  His column, “Different Strokes,” was the first weekly out gay newspaper column in the nation.  Please join the Temple Book Club in welcoming Thom Nickels to the Paley Library Lecture Hall at 1:00pm on Thursday, October 25.      For more information please contact Nicole Restaino, Library Communications Manager at 215-204-2828 or restaino@temple.edu.</p>
